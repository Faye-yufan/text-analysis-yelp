 1. My omelet was tasteless and overcooked. 
 2. My ""polenta"" was congealed glob of flavorless mush. 
 3. They forgot at least one thing from each of our dishes. 
 4. The bread was SO over-buttered that it fell apart when my father and brother were trying to eat their sandwiches.

Located under another bar/restaurant, I feel like they get overlooked due to that and to a lot of construction around the building. Fat Cat is tucked away under Rue Bourbon but is one place you NEED to pop by if you haven't. 
 

 I've been in once before and loved it! I had a friend who wanted to go to a happy hour and Fat Cat was perfect for that! I arrived first and the place was a ghost town minus a bartender and a patron. When my friend arrived, the bartender was quick with a suggestion for us drink wise. We both got the 'Frisky Kitty'. This drink is dangerously delicious! I had two during happy hour. 
 

 As we settled in and started to peruse the menu, so many items sounded wonderful. I would easily go back to try more as the appetizers we tried were FABULOUS! My friend and I ended up with the highly recommended Mushroom Gorgonzola fries and the Buffalo Mac n Cheese balls. Both were very rich in flavor. After splitting the two, I felt like I had ordered a whole meal; you certainly get a lot of food! 
 

 The place had a pristine feel to it. There isn't much clutter and this feels like the perfect place to get away from the usual happy hour crowds. Even during dinner service, it still wasn't packed. If you're looking for a place off the beaten path to try, definitely make a stop in to Fat Cat. Both times the waitress/bartender (Aggie?) was there in the afternoon/evening. She greets you with a kind smile and is very welcoming. 
 

 Only downside of the stop was the music was just a little too loud.

 My friend and I planned every moment of our trip to Nashville and we were SO looking forward to going to this restaurant. It just looked so cute being surrounded by the aquarium! I didn't have the highest expectations for the food since it was a restaurant located in a mall but I definitely didn't expect what happened.
 

 I called in about a week in advance to make a reservation and whoever answered the phone wasn't really friendly but I just assumed they were just tired and didn't think much of it.
 

 On the day of, my friend and I actually ended up showing up 10 minutes early and the hostess coldly told us we're too early and to go wait. She was so rude about it, we looked at the watch thinking maybe we had been hours early or something.
 They had live music at the mall right by the restaurant that day, so we just sat there waiting and was seated almost exactly at our reservation time.
 Inside, the restaurant looks really cool. The full aquarium with all the types of fish was really amazing! The server we had was really nice and we were really excited to try everything out.
 

 I ended up ordering the calamari as the appetizer and salmon as my main dish, and got a side of grilled shrimp.
 My friend ordered the ceviche as her appetizer, and then got shrimp tacos as the main dish.
 

 The calamari was really good, no complaints there.
 The ceviche was also mainly really good but the shrimp was incredibly rubbery, to the point we just didn't eat it.
 My friend's fish tacos were okay but again, the shrimp was overcooked. Thankfully, not to the point it was inedible.
 My salmon dish was really good but pretty greasy for some reason, the broccoli I subbed my asparagus for was grossly overcooked to the point it was grainy. The side of shrimp on the other hand, had an odor that threw me off, but I assumed it was the sauce and took a bite. It was so soft and mushy and tasted like........mush. I again thought it was just the sauce and told my friend to try it to see if thought it tasted bad too. She then told me it might be rotten, and I realized SHE WAS TOTALLY RIGHT.
 I then bit the tip of another one and although it wasn't soft like the first, it had the same rancid taste. I asked the waiter to come over and showed him how the first shrimp was mushy and grainy and that it smelled disgusting. He apologized and called the manager over.
 The manager was AWFUL.
 She told me she was sorry it didn't meet my ""expectations"" as if it was just me being picky, and told me it's the sauce on the shrimp that I'm complaining about.
 I got upset and told her it wasn't the sauce unless the sauce is acid that disintegrates the shrimp into mush.
 She rolled her eyes and said she would take it off our bill then.
 UNBELIEVABBLEEEEEE.
 As if it wasn't bad enough, I got food poisoning the next day. I could barely sit up let alone stand up. I thought I might be dying and considered going to the emergency room. In the end I didn't but it was really so awful.
 I was sick for 3 days and even threw up in the TSA line going home.
 I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND NO ONE ELSE SHOULD GO HERE.
 PLEASE. DO NOT COME HERE.
 

 I did end up calling 2 days later and telling them what happened but I made it clear I didn't want anything from them. Tbh I wanted a full refund but I didn't ask for it, because I wanted to make sure they understood how serious I was and not think it was just because I wanted my money back. But, they didn't even offer a refund, so there's that.
 Again, the moral of the story is...DO NOT GO HERE.",0,0,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,1

My friends and I ordered the fish fillet in hot sauce, the dan dan noodles, and the wontons in chili oil. I think all of these tasted very good, however the combination of them together was just too much oil, grease, and similar flavor, and we just had to stop eating these dishes at some point. That was our fault for ordering this together. 
 

 We looked for something else that was different. The menu is a little hard to read. It is on a board and kind of disorganized. We decided on a pork stir fry (the exact name escapes me) that looked like it had vegetables in it, something we really wanted after all the oil and spice. The pork stir fry was alright, a bit much on the sweet side.
 

 I think the food is good, but with the way their menu is presented it's hard to know what to order.

 Instead, our first round took 15 minutes (3 cocktails, a rum and coke, and a cup of wine) and we only had time for one more round in the hour and half we were there due to her being too caught up with her friends/patrons' instagrams and never looking our way. Once I walked over to get her attention, it took another 10 minutes for her to *start* making the drinks. 
 

 The cherry on top is that she attempted to charge us the full price of the drinks vs half the price as advertised blaming it on the computer. Boils down to her not paying attention at all throughout our visit.

They answered all of our questions and helped us narrow down our food order by recommending the Amal Attack and Incomparable Bacon Cheddar Burger. We also added an order of junkyard tots and onion strings. 
 

 The burgers were juicy, well flavored, and were exactly what we were looking for. Add to that some amazingly crispy tots with toppings and it was even better. 
 

 We'll definitely come back during our next trip to Philly.

I am a fan of any place that has an upscale but friendly atmosphere, and ITV is serving that and more. From the bartenders to the food runners to the drink menu to the small bites, I can't say nicer things about my first experience at ITV. As thrilled as I am with my experience there, I'm cursing myself for not taking notes on what I was consuming - I can literally only remember a delicious cocktail with grapefruit juice in it (even then I can only verify a citrus juice), the crackling pork rinds, and the best green salad I've ever had (or at least rivaling Amada). I feel like there was a fish-based dish that I consumed, but this is what happens when you drink more than you eat (which is super tempting given the amazing drink menu). Since we sat at the bar, we were waited on by the bartender, and he was both informative and a skilled drink maker.

16540,Gwl0Y6o44y_j3bUK4P8i3g,"I can say, with confidence, I've never been to this neck of Wedgewood-Houston before. I've driven past it (usually at light speed and yelling at a Nashville driver) many times but never thought to venture up the hill and see what's there. So, *this* is Fort Houston? Good to know after so long. 
 

 If you're not like me and knew where Fort Houston was, The Loading Dock may come as a surprise. Actually, it may come as a surprise anyway as it looks to be a fairly new coffee addition to the Fort Houston work/art space. As a concept and a business, it makes perfect sense. I hope, as words grows, more people have the chance to frequent the space (although I was pretty impressed by the constant stream of traffic I witnessed).
 

 The walls are white and adorned with art. The majority of the tables are wood four tops but there is some quirky, comfortable seating by the door/window. Once you get settled, make your way to the counter and gets to eating/drinking. The menu isn't too terribly huge but there's enough variety to satisfy most any consumer. They even have gluten-free bread which put the sandwich options in play! Unfortunately, the delicious-looking sweets were off limits. 
 

 I need to fully recognize that I am not a coffee man. I'll drink it if that's the only option but I prefer tea and should stick to it. I ordered a brown sugar cinnamon latte and it came out piping hot and nicely flavored. BUT I also ordered an avocado toast (I can never get these things due to the whole gluten-free PITA) and the tastes did NOT go well together. This is not one's fault but my own. Before the barista gave me a well-earned and very gracious side-eye, I was about to order a grilled cheese with flavored coffee. Yeah, I see it now, too. Needing to fix my drink choice, I went with a 'Mexican Coke' and all was well. My toast was delicious: creamy avocado, diced tomatoes, sliced almonds, and everything bagel seasoning -- the secret weapon. Once I corrected the drink choice, everything was coming up Milhouse.
 

 The space is comfortable. The people are nice. The product is good (I am going to try tea with a flavored shot next time). The Loading Dock is a hit.

 Thursday night I went in and had pho with a friend of mine. He is not a smoker, so we didn't stay very long. We did however stay long enough to enjoy a huge bowl of pho. The chef uses his mother'a meatball recipe and they simmer the savory broth for about 5 hours. It is honestly one of the best bowls of pho I have ever had. The broth and savory the flank steak and meatballs are delicious, it does not have the tripe that some people object to. This does not impact the quality of the pho or the flavor. Everything is very fresh and delightful. The bowls are huge, so bring your appetite!!
 

 Tonight I went back solo. It is at this point that I should tell you that this is not only a top-quality Asian restaurant, but also one of the finest cigar bars that I have ever been to, and I have been to a lot of them. If you want to watch the big game they have four flat panel tVs that will allow you to watch whatever you want. Tonight I watched Alabama beat on Mizzou.
 

 The staff, including the bartender Ben, are very attentive. I cannot say enough about the kind hearted and beautiful wait staff, Kim was my waitress along with another young lady whose name I forget, but she was absolutely wonderful, too.
 

 Tonight I started with the Vietnamese summer rolls I had one of shrimp and another a barbecue pork, the pork was a powerhouse of flavor. The shrimp was fresh and the rolls were crisp and delightful. I then moved on to the ahi tuna appetizer, one of the best that I've had. I am not damning these people with false praise, the food is just that good. I then had the most unique preparation of steak that I have ever experienced. Steak Tisho is filet mignone sliced paper thin and presented raw with butter and garlic. The server then ""cooks it"" with a torch at table side. This is not a ribeye, it is a small portion maybe 3 ounces at most, it is packed with flavor and is delightful, so much so that it melts in your mouth. The entire experience was fantastic.
 

 Now word about their drinks list, they appear to have every type of scotch known to man. I had a 14-year-old Oban that was incredible. It was the perfect accompaniment to the cigar I had. It was a La Aurora Puro, and was from a limited series of 1000 boxes. Very impressive. Later I had a glass of Talisker with a nice Arturo Fuente.

 It's a cute place. Of course it's all about cute salads that you likely have had at some time in your life whether at a potluck or your grandmother made for summer lunch. I tried the lemon basil chicken salad and broccoli salad. My friend had an egg salad sandwich and grape salad. Although they were both tasty we weren't blown away with what we got for $9 each. The portions were about 1/2 cup; which is a reasonable portion but at the price I can't see this place making it for an extended time. 
 It's a walk up and order and we'll bring it to your table place. If you really like these types of salads and don't want to ""Google"" recipes then you'll like it.

I'm glad we dined in as the dining area was very calming with a comfortable atmosphere. 
 

 I do wish I'd checked out the online menu before going in. I had trouble deciding so quickly with no wait and I hadn't grasped the concept of a Chipotles until I had ordered. Next time I'm looking forward to trying the Diavolo Pasta. I love you can add protein, (meatballs, Italian sausage, chicken, salmon or calamari) or leave the entree vegetarian. After sampling the Calamari I think I might add to my pasta dish on my next visit.
 

 The service was terrific with exceptionally friendly and patient servers as I tried to decide. I ordered the Calamari which was fried with hot peppers and served with pomodora sauce. Excellent and I really enjoyed the addition of the hot peppers. It was a respectable size serving and the breading didn't overwhelm the Calamari.
 

 The Summer Avocado Piada was really tasty. Even though I'm not a big burrito fan, I greatly enjoyed the roasted sweet corn, tomatoes, fresh avocado and pancetta. The basil aioli complemented the veggies nicely. The thin, grilled dough was wonderful but I think I'd enjoy it more on the side and have the filling as a salad.
 

 My friend had the Farmers Market Salad which looked delicious. It was a nice blend of mixed greens, shaved cabbage, roasted sweet corn, spiced pecans, strawberries and finished off with a lemon basil dressing. This is her go to salad.

 I've always thought it to be fairly empty, so when needing a quick, but nice lunch that wasn't a chain I made the suggestion to give it a try. Good call, Michelle, good call. So, it really wasn't empty and I don't know why I thought it had been- perhaps restaurants of location past came back to haunt my memory? There were a few folks ahead of us in line, but due to the cafeteria style serving and pre-prepped food, it didn't take long at all to order. We could've easily taken our food to go or sat at the picnic bench style table in the center, but a table for four opened up and I quickly snagged it for my group. 
 

 $10.95 for the salad, two sides and protein seemed a little pricy at first, but we got a crazy amount of food. I went with the kale salad, pesto eggplant, chicken quinoa and chicken marsala. It was enough food to be dinner sized. Although each item was already made and in a tray, it tasted hot and fresh. Chicken bores me when out, but the Marsala was really juicy. The chicken quinoa was actually a little bit on the boring side, and I'm a fan if quinoa. 
 

 So I went into this review ready to go out a five, but thinking about the four items, I'm scaling it back down to a four. Nothing was really stellar, but altogether it was quality, filling and had a good value.
 

 They also sell bottled beer, and if you pick your own six pack you save 10%. I wasn't drinking on that visit, but nothing looked too inspiring.

506233,j7Up0cAS3KeEzthh3e5Tcw,"When I told people I knew that my husband and I were going to Nashville, this was one spot people told me I couldn't miss. And the people are right.
 

 This museum is amazing and goes over so much Johnny Cash history. It's located right off Broadway so a really easy spot for tourists, like me, who are visiting and want to get some history. It starts from his early childhood and goes through his entire life. There are artifacts everywhere, from clothes he wore on stage, to letters he wrote to friends (even before he was famous). I was completely taken aback at by how incredible this was. 
 

 The tour is self guided and you can just walk through and enjoy everything. There's lots to read and enjoy and they even have some videos and music you can listen to. I also appreciated that there were bathrooms inside the actual museum because they let us know once we were in there and left, we wouldn't be able to come back in. We took about two hours to soak up as much as we could. They allow you to take photos but no videos.
 

 The last part of the museum is where they play his music video ""Hurt"" and even showcase the chair he sat in, as well as the ring he wore. I felt so completely moved by it.
 

 Definitely would recommend this as a must-see and must-experience in Nashville. And since we visited a week ago, I can't get the song ""walk the line"" out of my head, but not complaining.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

282110,xMjoFTNDQ-Hh1xGAU3Be2w,"When it comes to chain restaurants, I usually only stop by when I need food fast and on the go. Well, one day I was craving a burger and wanted one for the ride home from work. And the closest place from where I work was the good 'ol Steak 'n Shake in South Reno. I proceeded to order through their drive thru and I was surprised on how good their burgers were. 
 

 As mentioned above, I ordered food to-go from their drive thru one day after work. I ordered a few items since I was feeling pretty hungry. I decided to get their Garlic Double (4.99), Original Double 'N Cheese (4.99), the Portobello 'N Swiss (8.49), and lastly their White Truffle Prime Steakburger (8.99). After paying, the person working the drive thru said it'll be just a moment for the Prime Steakburger. The wait wasn't long at all and I was pretty astonished that there was an actual wait time, unlike most fast food burger joints that usually have your food ready soon after ordering. After a couple of minutes, I was handed a bag with all of my goodies and I drove home eager to eat those burgers. Firstly, when it comes to presentation, there really is none. Their burgers are wrapped up tightly and once unraveled, usually are covered in oil and grease. But that's to be expected. But what they lack in presentation, they make up for in taste. Each burger was uniquely delicious. The Portobello 'N Swiss was packed with mushrooms, just the way I like it. The Garlic Double is perfect for those who absolutely love garlic. Their Original Double 'N Cheese was a classic double cheeseburger. The White Truffle Prime Steakburger had a slight taste of truffle, but overall was pretty good. 
 

 I visited a week later, and noticed the drive thru had a couple cars in it, so I decided to park and order from inside. After I walked through their front doors, I was completely blindsided when I saw a ""Wait To Be Seated"" sign and a bunch of diner styled booths filled with people munching away. One of their waitresses asked how many people were in my party and I quickly blurted out ""Just one."" As I was seated in one of their booths in the front, I thought to myself ""Maybe I should have just gone through the drive..."" But oh well, I was there and I decided to get the full experience. As their restaurant name suggested, I had both a Steak(burger) and Shake. I wanted to try their White Truffle Prime Steakburger again and for the shake, I got the Very Berry Strawberry Shake. Both burger and fries arrived on a plate, not wrapped. And since the burger was freshly made, it looked great! Not only was it appealing in looks, but it tasted so much better than if it were to eaten to-go. Food is just better eaten freshly made, rather than letting it sit, even if it is just for a couple of minutes. The shake was very much refreshing and a nice compliment to the burger. Food and drinks aside, service was also good. My waitress would frequently check up on me to see how I was doing. At first, I wished to have gone through their drive-thru, but after my dining experience here, I'm pleasantly happy about my surprise mistake. And just so you know, you can actually just order up in the front if you don't wish to dine in. 
 

 If I learned anything today, it's that Steak 'N Shake definitely stands out from those other contending fast food burger joints. I want to say that Steak 'N Shake falls right in the middle when it comes to being a fast food and sit down restaurant. If wanted your burger to-go, there's always the drive through. But if you have time to kill and want a classic diner experience, stop by and dine in. Their dine in menus are more extensive with all sorts of sides, salads, and other entrees. I know for a fact that if I'm craving burgers again, Steak 'N Shake will be my next stop.",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

546426,cBq7bcA5tqKKE2_P1Pfoqg,"My friends and I ate here during Memorial Day weekend, which hiked up the dinner price by about $5. Make sure you come here starving or something because the price per head will make a dent in your wallet. 
 

 I went for the expensive stuff first. You have to get your money's worth, duh! The main attractions (for me at least) would be prime rib, brisket, crab legs, and lobster ravioli. Everything was pretty tasty, too, which is always a plus at a buffet. They also have a pho station and a made to order salad station! Another station worth noting is the cheese, meat, and crackers station, which I thought was really cool to see at a buffet, yet so dangerous lol. 
 

 There is also a wide array of desserts. First stop: gelato! Was it the best gelato I've ever had? No. It tasted more like icy ice cream, but it was decent. Make sure you don't miss the chocolate fountain! You have to stand in line and an employee will dip fruits/rice krispies for you. Once the chocolate sets, though, it'll be stuck to the plate. None of the desserts really wowed me, unfortunately. 
 

 The service here was decent. Our waiter would disappear from time to time, which is understandable, considering it is a huge buffet. It just sucked when we needed water refills or napkins. Also, there were tons of families here with their kids, who were running around and playing in the restaurant. Their parents didn't even try to stop them! Be mindful of this when you're navigating to your table carrying your plate (or two) because my friend almost tripped over a kiddo! 
 

 Tbh, I don't see myself coming back here. It's too expensive! I shouldn't have come during a holiday weekend, which is my own fault, but I definitely don't think this was worth $40 per person (after tax).",0,-1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,-1,0
536013,Mloz1m-q72NhpLmbxtmlfw,"Hellfire Saloon is an unexpected delight! I have lived in the neighborhood for a few years, but I never figured that there was a decent hangout spot in the shopping center at S. McCarran and Mira Loma...Boy, was I wrong! A few different businesses have occupied the space over the past few years, and when I noticed Hellfire's sign last year, I just figured it was a divey biker bar. 
 

 Don't get it twisted, I love me some dive bars, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover how clean, open, and family-friendly Hellfire Saloon actually is! The restaurant is open, friendly, well-lit, and smoke-free, with ample room for parties. They have live music several nights per week, and offer full bar and restaurant services at VERY affordable prices! This bar is so much nicer than it looks from the outside, and the waitstaff is great! Our server was so attentive, friendly, and anticipated our needs better than Miss Cleo! (I know, I'm dating myself here, but I hope you're old enough to know to whom I'm referring...) I got so into the music (Lawdog Marks), that I didn't even catch my excellent server bussing my empty cocktail and when I turned my head back to my friends at the table, Presto Chango! A brand new drink was right in front of me! Excellent service!!!
 

 I am withholding a star because I ate dinner before visiting Hellfire, and I want to taste their food! Some nearby patrons were noshing on simple caesar salads, and I could smell the deliciousness from my adjacent table...It says a lot about food quality when a simple salad smells that good! My only caveat is that the bartender was a little pissy when I ordered my last call drink. Last call had already been ordered, and the bartender was busy closing checks, so he didn't notice me for a few minutes. He totally gave me an attitude and said it was past call when I ordered, but I politely said that I was waiting for him to turn around and notice me. He had no problem filling the last call orders of other patrons that were right beside me (who had been likely ordering all night), and he didn't give any of them a hard time. He still filled my order, but he definitely watered it down. Whatever, it was the end of the night, and I understand wanting to close down. I just don't get why it's more acceptable to fill one patron's order over another's, especially when you're still filling orders. We're all human though, and this hiccup is no reason to downgrade Hellfire. I'm totally excited to come back and taste their menu!",0,1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

You must always get a side of whipped feta and hummus (but they don't use the traditional raw garlic like in Israel). But - it's overrated and the service was just so poor that I couldn't recommend this place again.
 

 Generally- Nashville is filled with southern hospitality. But - we had a reservations for 1:30pm and did not sit down until 2:15pm with no prior notice that they were behind until we got there! It was clear they were busy, and the bartenders seemed bothered by you since we didn't have anything to do - but wait. If you are with a bridal shower, bachelorette, or have some type of out of town appearance - they are just not as friendly to your party. At least- that is how I felt. And with 45 minutes of no southern hospitality, they didn't even offer to comp our drinks or hummus. I thought this was just poor business etiquette. The staff also (besides the owner - who was nice but scattered) did not understand the history of the food and what ingredients where in it. 
 

 The Food:
 1) Feta
 2) Hummus
 3) Kale Salad

The restaurant is located on the corner of Main Street in a very nice setting. They have outside seating, but as a fan of interior design, I decided to sit inside. The interior design was pretty neat and well decorated, and the furniture was living room style, I felt like I was sitting in someone's living room! There was a live band playing nice music and one of the guys was also singing. Very inviting vibe and casual atmosphere. 
 

 There is a long list of drinks on their drink menu at very reasonable prices. The food menu was rich and lots of menu options and dishes to choose from. The staff were friendly, but the service was a little slow. Fortunately, the restaurant has an awesome manager, Rebecca, who noticed my frustration and made it right for me. Kudos to her management style!! Jeremie also stopped by to make sure I was satisfied with my food!
 

 I started with the hummus, and for entree I got the wagyu sliders with steak fries and a second side of Mac n cheese. Even though Mac was extra charge, it sounded too good to miss. There were some eggplant dishes I wanted to try, but Wagyu or corned beef hash will always be my first choice! The sliders were delicious, the steak fries were awesome make sure you get a side of BBQ sauce (you'll thank me later), and the Mac n cheese was bomb.

I always try the fried pickles when I go somewhere new, and these were battered light and had a said that was zingy and perfect. So far, I think this is one of my top places for these! And add for the cheese cake. It was decadent. My friend ordered the skins, which were a bit done and ok. But, I would definitely return and eat here again! I got a Togo order of the burger and onion rings too, and these were delicious from what my Mom's full mouth and smiles indicated :). 
 The interior is cozy and the dining is seperated from the bar. I think this is nice because I think the selection allows for dining atmosphere and the bar to have different feels. And, people can come with family and relax in the one side, while those that come wanting the bar aren't sitting next to a family of children. To me, this is a plus.

 I also tried thier shrimp and scallop linguine alla vodka. The pasta was good and tasty, but my only thing about the plate was that it was not presentable. I mean if you're going to wow your customer with high price plate, you need to make it presentable and desirable to eat. It looked like a half empty plate with not much pasta and basil.

43875,Uk3FNC_iwkmlFJz49mD_2g,"My wife and I were taking our grandson to the duckpin bowling next door and decided to stop in at this restaurant for convenience. I liked that they had a lot of options that our grandson could choose from. So after we found some free street parking down the street, we were directed by the waitress to choose a spot and she would bring our menus over.
 

 They have lots of barbecue options, as well as burgers, some fried fish, and a different daily lunch special. Our grandson selected the Thursday special, beef manhattan. When he saw the platter (not just a plate), he couldn't believe it! Lots of sliced beef topped the bread and then real mashed potatoes were nestled in the middle with gravy. He loved the flavor, but he didn't come close to finishing the food. (Fortunately, they have large take home boxes too!)
 

 My wife ordered a beer battered fish (cod) sandwich that had about 6 ounces of meat. Thick sliced, the sandwich was a challenge to eat because of the height which included tomato, onion, lettuce, and tartar sauce. She ordered the sweet potato fries with a dipping sauce as her side. She thought the sandwich very satisfying...not amazing, but better than expected.
 

 I decided to go with the beef brisket sandwich with the krinkle fries. I had my choice of several sauces to put on the meat, choosing a raspberry chipotle. The meat was thick sliced (about 3/8"") and though it wasn't piled high, was plenty to eat. The meat was nicely flavored from the slow roasting but did have a slightly spongy texture. It was moist and mostly tender, but did make for an unusual bite. But overall, it was a good sandwich too. Note that the fries were unseasoned, so I helped myself to the table salt shaker.
 

 I honestly have to say I had my expectations exceeded considering the average rating of 3 stars the restaurant has at the time of my review. It has a nice vibe of late 50's to 60's era music and drive in posters on the wall. Service was friendly and fairly prompt. Portions were generous for the prices. A solid four if you like a bit of nostalgia with your lunch.

No lie, from his first bite all I heard was, ""this is the best burger I've ever eaten."" Until he got to the end....and he seriously looked like someone shot his dog, I swear there were tears in his eyes. So yeah, this place is a five star for burgers. Even my picky, super whiney, buzz killing 9-year old ate his plain Jane beef patty on a bun with a smile - and that, my friends, is the true test. You want a burger...pick any burger joint othe list. But if you want a TASTY burger, make your next stop the Stock and Barrel.
 

 Update: dropping a star, I hate when that happens. Went back to Stock and Barrel to enjoy another tasty burger and sadly, the second experience paled greatly in comparison to the first. My husband went for the buffalo burger again, but it had way too much of the garlic cheese spread, he didn't even finish it this time. I ordered the hurt locker and ended up with the ring of fire, which had a super hard bun. And one of my kids ordered the steakhouse burger which came without the bacon (). To top it off the food came out at varying times, and one person was left in that awkward moment of being the only person at the table without food. Needless to say, the disappointment was high.

This is a paleta shop, gourmet mexican ice cream on a stick with the refreshing creaminess that makes me think of gelato. Like its last two predecessors, the paleta bar also offers toppings and drizzles to customize your treat. They offer several choices for cream flavors, and between that and the toppings the choices are ENDLESS. But I zoned in on my classic go to faves. I went for a coffee flavored paleta with dark chocolate coating, pecans, chocolate with caramel drizzle. It hit the spot on a sweltering hot day. The ice cream itself was creamy and smooth, yet had a good bite to it, and didn't leave me with a messy mouth. It paired well with the dark chocolate shell and crunchy pecans, so I had a good variety of flavors and textures to contemplate as i enjoyed my treat. The worker behind the counter was very nice and had alot of energy as he explained everything they have to offer.

We arrived at 2:15 and were told it would be about 45 min. We were okay with that, as it seemed to be a new place and obviously very popular. We browsed the menu and noticed the neat decorations throughout the restaurant and outside. Our wait was the best part of our experience. After only about 20 min we were seated and were pleasantly surprised that we were seated so quickly. With two mechanics in our party of four, they definitely enjoyed the touches throughout-shop rags as napkins, gas pumps and tires as sinks in the restrooms, etc. Our server and the service we received didn't make up for the best atmosphere. It took quite awhile to be greeted and drink orders taken, where we also all ordered soup/salad. After dropping our drinks off (soft drinks only), we didn't see him again for nearly 20 minutes. Our soups and salad arrived and one in our party had only a partly filled soup cup (less than half full) while the others had heaping bowls (and at about $6 a serving you want your money's worth!). The salad also didn't arrive as ordered. But our server wasn't the one to drop it off, and the food runner seemed a little put off by the fact that we made mention of the soup and salad issues. At this point our server had still not ever returned to take our meal order. Finally we caught him and requested to order. At this point we knew that it was going to be quite some time before our meals would ever be arriving. After taking the order, we sat unattended and with empty glasses for probably another 20 minutes. We finally got drink refills and were told the food was almost up. Then 10 minutes later were told the same thing. Eventually food arrived, and our party had mixed reviews. Some loved it, some found it underwhelming. We had to ask our server twice for a box, in addition to the check, as we were sitting, waiting, clearly finished as he seemed to avoid our table completely. I'm usually not one to complain to management, but if a manager had ever been seen (I never saw one despite looking, though I didn't directly ask) I would have given very frustrated feedback. At this point, the restaurant has been open over a month, and service should be improving, one would think.

 Some of the best cocktails in Philly, not to mention quality plates of food that live up to the same high standard! Perfect place to enjoy a few drinks and exquisitely tasty bites with a friend in a classy vintage setting; space is limited though, come early or late to avoid the 6-8 pm crowd. 
 

 Favorite cocktails so far:
 CONTROL STATE -- vodka, lime, grapefruit, honey, savory bitters
 SWEET NOTHINGS -- calvados, lemon-coriander shrub, prosecco, cilantro
 

 Loved the eggs and caviar with mushroom duxelles and vin blanc ($16) which were little umami bombs - savory light egg mousse atop rich mushrooms and topped with more ""Egg"" (caviar) - served inside perfectly hollowed out egg shells (can you have too much egg? I think not). Chicken liver mousse toasts with caramelized foie gras, date molasses, and mustard ($15) were divine as well - impossibly smooth and rich mousse and perfected toasted cavernous slices of sourdough bread.

I always have trouble deciding which to order, everything I have had here is delicious.
 

 I love sides, and Burger Fuel does not disappoint. The spud fries are thick cut and excellent, especially with the aioli and craft ketchup. Kumara are delicious as well, and the Motobites (pumpkin, carrot, chickpea and ginger) are truly unique.
 

 They have special sides and burgers for limited times. Today I ordered the pickle fries, which were served with the aioli on the side.
 

 Burger Fuel also features soft serve shakes and cones, both dairy and dairy-free varieties.

Located close to the Truckee River it is conducive to a nice walk along the river park before or, as we did after dinner. The restaurant is smallish but we had a great table overlooking Sierra Street. There is a stamped tin ceiling and beautiful wood bar. We were greeted by very friendly wait staff.
 

 We started with drinks. My wife had champagne which is available by the glass. I had a nice Merlot. The wine list is very complete. In addition there was a nice selection of bottled beers and craft cocktails.
 

 While there are entrees available the menu centers on small plates. We started with figs wrapped in bacon with goat cheese along with macaroni and cheese. Delicious!!! Then came Brussels sprouts with bacon and chili pepper. My wife had the bulk of these and loved them. We got an order of cauliflower fried in panko and served in buffalo sauce with bleu cheese dressing billed as ""cauliflower hot wings."" They were incredible. Lastly an order of the Triple Threat Sliders which I focused on and loved.

 From the first time I heard of this restaurant, it was on my ""places to go"" list. The popularity was astounding. I heard people say their wait times were 1.5-2 hours long. As a result, I waited for the hype to die down & I'm soooooooo glad I did. 
 

 The menu is quite extensive, but I came for 1 thing and 1 thing ONLY... THE SEAFOOD BAG!!! 
 

 (1st visit) Looking at the menu, there are lots of choices to be made. And it never hurts to peruse the menu, but I knew I came for SEAFOOD BAG & that's all I could see on the menu. That being said, when our server came, we ordered & I was asked of the level of spiciness that I preferred for my ""bag"" (bag of seafood). I'm that girl, so I asked for the ""hottest/spiciest"" level. 
 

 My anticipation was super high... I just knew the spicy seafood was gonna ""tear my MOUF out""... I WAS DISAPPOINTED. Not only was it ""not super duper spicy"" as the server explained, it also LACKED flavor... It was bland. Although, there was LOTS of buttery-sauce coating the seafood, the seafood flavor & spiciness were BOTH lacking. I was majorly disappointed. 
 

 (2nd visit) It is to be noted, that I returned, because I thought maybe the 1st visit was a fluke; but sadly it wasn't. Once again, the seafood was NEITHER spicy nor properly flavored. 
 

 This is LOUISIANA... Bland seafood SHOULD be illegal, lol. I won't be returning. I'll take my hopes and anticipation of spiciness & seafood flavor ELSEWHERE.

Now for the negative. We were told 45 mins to an hour wait. And we waited over 90 mins. We were fine with a long wait but wish we would have known it would be almost 2 hours vs under an hour. Also there's no way of knowing which tables are first come first serve...there are apparently a lot of them, but we weren't told this at the check in desk, or else we would have just done that instead of waiting as long as we did. Anyways, on to the dinner. We sat down and it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by. We ordered drinks and food when someone came by since we had plenty of time to review the menu and we assumed the kitchen would be slow. Apps and dinner came out all at once and super fast within 10 mins of ordering. Which was good because we were starving after the long wait for the table but after tasting the food we realized it comes out so fast because it's not cooked fresh. We ordered some steamers (mussels and clams) which cook very fast and are super easy to make to order, however they came out room temp, almost cold. It seemed like they were steamed way ahead of time then slightly reheated and served. If they were cooked fresh they would have still been hot, that's how fast the food came out, unless they were sitting under a fan before being brought out, which seems unlikely. Flavor of the mussel broth was good though. Fish dip was okay, super liquidy. Fritters barely had any meat in them. Fries didn't have salt. But the Tuna was good and so was the coconut shrimp. I really hope this feedback helps the restaurant because I do want this place to succeed. I'm sure it will, but hopefully they don't rely on the view/atmosphere alone.

We all tried and shared so many items off of the Restaurant Week menu that it is hard to comment on everything. We did begin with a raw seafood sampler that was not on the special menu but included oysters, crab meat, and shrimps with various sauces. A good beginning! Now to the Restaurant Week items themselves. The warm rolls and salads were fine, the entrees for the most part didn't disappoint, and there was a choice of chocolate or cheesecake for dessert. I thought the lobster ravioli could use some more seasoning and the spaetzle that came with the tender braised short ribs was too dried out but the scallops and roasted Brussels sprouts were right on. Service by Rocco was both efficient and very friendly and we enjoyed a couple of good bottles of dry Italian wine which added to the dinner. In addition to the food and wine, there was an excellent singer from Northern Ireland providing music. (He usually sings on Wednesday nights and has a nice repertoire of songs that he covers.) The general manager John also checked in with us....especially to aid in the wine selections. All in all, Vesper was a really good Restaurant week choice!",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
297081,_7VQ-80oFO8fs9IPFe0FCQ,"First let me say that I find it hard to believe that Captain D's is 50+ years old. I remember when they first opened in Jeffersonville, Indiana. They had the best fish, shrimp, chicken anywhere. But over the years I have found that many of these restaurants we have stopped at around the country, were nothing like I remembered. We recently moved to Mooresville, Indiana, I surprised my wife by telling her there was a Captain D's here (Greenwood). We've often reminisced about eating there when we were young. Well of course, we had to check it out. Honestly, she said she felt like she had died and gone to heaven. The food was just as we remembered it.  
 

 She got the sample platter that came with fish, chicken, and shrimp plus a side, she got green beans. She likes those little crunchy pieces that are under the food. Delicious. My granddaughter opted for the kids chicken meal and I can tell you she is very picky about her chicken. She gave it a big thumbs up! She also had the churro sticks for dessert and not a one was left.  
 

 This time I ordered the Southern Style fish platter. The batter is different than their normal fish but more similar to what other seafood is served elsewhere. I can't decide which I like better. I've also ordered other platters with shrimp or stuffed crab and its all good. Now there is one item that is the bomb and that's the hush puppies! I've only found one other place outside of New Orleans (former 20+ yr resident) that has an as good recipe and that's Kingfish in Jeffersonville and Louisville. 
 

 My wife tells me that there is nothing better than dipping their chicken into their own sweet and sour sauce. You have to ask for it, they don't have it out with the regular condiments. She said anyone who likes sweet and sour sauce will love Captain D's sweet and sour sauce.
 

 We've already been back once and I expect it will be a once a week place to eat for us. It was certainly nice to know that there is actually a Captain D's where we live that lives up to the standard of the first Captain D's we ate at years ago. A big shout out to the manager.

465435,CRAa89rt-afxdkT767vfMQ,"Summary: the menu has the word ""curated"" on it. Either you're into this type of place, or you're not. I'm not, but I did pay $7 for an environmental disaster of a dessert, so here's my take. 
 

 First off, this place is pretty overpriced. $7 for a small cone of soft serve and cubes of cake is hardly a good value. I'm not sure if I'm able to fully judge the desert, I got a curated chocolate flavored cone that was supposed to come with chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake, and chocolate ganache. There was no ganache in or on the cone, which probably would have helped overall. 
 

 The dessert is sold in a cheap, fragile clear plastic cone. I suppose this is for Instagram users, but I would assume most of these people would be concerned about the massive amount of garbage this is creating, for no benefit other than AESTHETIC. This aesthetic would be served better by serving the dessert in a glass reusable container that doesn't crack in your hand under a slight bit of pressure. 
 

 This establishment would do well to invent something portable, cheap and delicious to house the dessert if they don't want to use glass. I'm imagining maybe throwing waffle batter in a really flat griddle, made fresh for the customer, and rolling it into a cone shape while it's still malleable. You could call this thing a ""waffle cone"". If the staff is overwhelmed, maybe the dessert curator could come in and make them while the severs fill them...",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,0

 The restaurant is a family business, who owns its own fleet that goes out for fresh catches to supply the restaurant and its seafood market next door. You really can taste the difference between the shrimps here to those frozen stuff from Asia. 
 

 If they have rock shrimp, give it a try. You don't often see it on menus or in markets, they are a local specialty. And grouper too, fresh and local. Their desserts are home made, baked daily by one of the family members.  
 

 They serve hush puppies in a paper bag to start you off. I really like how they keep updating their menu over the years, keeping up with food trends. Like, they have poke bowl now.

Then I dig into some bland Brussels sprouts but no biggie because if I want a kick in the butt again, I just dig into some mash wasabi, I mean potatoes or did I mean wasabi? It too was loaded.

58919,gfIAuixCu2AjFa4OJZYi7A,"Wow, the lunch here was really awesome! I've always loved the whole Honey Baked hams no matter what location. It's my favorite spiral ham of all the places that sell them. I remember making sandwiches for days off of one of these hams. But, I never actually ordered a sandwich at the store. I was pleasantly surprised. 
 

 First of all, the service was great. I was in and out within 5 or 10 minutes. There was no one there at the time so I'm sure it would take longer if there was a line. The menu is simple. They have ham, turkey, chicken salad, and ham salad. They have various types of sandwiches and breads to choose from as well. I got the half sandwich and half salad combo. I chose the classic ham sandwich on multigrain bread. The bread was soft and fresh. It had their famous thickly sliced spiral ham with the sugar coating along with lettuce, tomato, Duke's mayo, and their honey mustard. It was really good. The mayo and sweet mustard combination was perfect. Okay, I guess anyone could make a ham sandwich at home but this was a quality sandwich. Hey, I'm easily impressed I guess. The side salad was also very fresh and included your choice of Ken's Steakhouse dressing. It was a very healthy lunch. How did I not know that they serve lunch? Maybe because I've been to other locations that don't serve lunch. Who the heck knows?
 

 Well, I will definitely return whenever I'm in the area for one of these freshly made sandwiches. It's not very often because I really hate that mall traffic, but I will go whenever I'm craving Honey Baked ham. Now I don't have to buy the whole ham just to satisfy that craving.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,-1
33596,BD2IJzW6GlAlDLmQjP_WmA,"The food is very top notch here, so that definitely deserves a 5 stars. My group and I really did enjoy our different versions of Eggs Benedict. It was flavorful, very savory, and such a great dish. I personally ordered the version that included either the crab or lobster and it was really delicious. So, the criticism doesn't really rely on the food itself. It more so relies on the waiter that took our orders.
 

 His name was Michael and he was a great guy, until towards the very end when he had brought our check over. We asked if we could split the check. To that, he slowly put his hands together with a slight heavy sigh so that we all took notice and replied with, 
 

 ""We are currently slammed at the moment. It would have been better if you guys had told me in the very beginning to get split checks"", he said with a disappointed look. 
 

 He just stood there while we took a quick glance at each other. We had told him that it would be no problem, and we could pay on one card and the rest of us would Venmo that individual. We were perfectly fine with doing this, but we were not okay at all with his approach to the situation. 
 

 Isn't it standard work process for the waiter themselves to ask in the beginning if we are all going to be on one check or if it's going to be separated? Because that's what we came to be familiar with when working with our waiters. 
 

 With that, our only critique is this. Please train your waiter(s) about proper standard work process and to follow suit to those of other restaurants. I honestly hope that the establishment takes this critique very seriously , because I wouldn't want another group to experience the same feeling of pressure that we felt from Michael. Other then that, we did thoroughly enjoy the food, just not the waiter.",1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

555266,hEQ_KqKEIusxFV9x69F6_w,"Emeril's is Lagasse's namesake restaurant on Tchoupitoulas in New Orleans. While it is streetside with large windows, it is a beautiful restaurant. There is a full bar as well as a large dining room that looks towards the kitchen that is open to the dining room. We were nearly as far from the dining room as you could be, so I did not see much there.
 

 We had 3 servers who were working with our table. At the beginning of service, they were a little distracted because they were winding down after a busy lunch service (our lunch reservation was at 1PM). Fortunately, we were pretty relaxed and were not overly anxious about being served.
 

 Because of the size of our party and our appetite, we did 3 courses, but we shared so I was able to try many dishes. For our appetizers, we had:
 

 Homemade Andouille and Boudin Sausages: a 3.5"" link of a soft boudin sausage (white sausage with rice) and a 3.5"" link of smoked andouille were served atop slow cooked collard greens and topped with a piece of toast and beer braised onions with a bit of country mustard on the side. The sausages were great. The white sausage was mild and very well-seasoned. The andouille had a nice heat. The greens were mild and the onions were sweet. The tangy mustard was just right.
 

 Blue Crab and Brie: fresh angel hair pasta was tossed in a brie cream sauce with fresh corn kernels, shredded sweet crab meat and slices of jalapeno. This was a sweet and spicy dish that was well prepared.
 

 Escargots Buorguigon: 4 halves of red potatoes were each filled with escargots and resting in a pool of garlic butter and topped with bacon-breadcrumbs and sweetbreads. I don't like potatoes, and the escargots were a little small, which was a letdown. The sweetbreads were great - very tender and fresh. The herbed butter and bacon breadcrumbs were also great.
 

 Seafood Gumbo: well-seasoned brown based soup with generous chunks of seafood, bits of okra and quite a bit of rice. This was very good - not the best that I have had, but very good.
 

 Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad: shredded sprouts were tossed with cubes of unripened peaches in a vinaigrette and topped with grated parmesan and half of a soft boiled egg. This (and the sausage) were the two best appetizers. The crispy veggies with the tangy vinaigrette and nutty cheese and rich egg were a nice combination. The peaches were flavorless, but it was very good.
 

 LO1 had the BBQ shrimp for lunch. There were four or five super tender shrimp covered in barbecue sauce made with housemade Worcestershire sauce and topped with chives and served with a little buttermilk biscuit. She inhaled the biscuit so I did not get a bite, but the shrimp were great.
 

 LO2 had a custom made grilled cheese sandwich. A brioche bun was grilled with cheddar cheese and served with housemade French fries. The sandwich was fantastic, and she ate almost all of it!
 

 For our entrees, we had:
 

 Crusted Gulf Drum: my choice was a flakey white fish that was crusted in a seasoned breadcrumb mixture and served atop a mélange of red bell pepper, zucchini and mirliton squash with a flavorful brown sauce. I thought it was amazing. Light fish with a crispy exterior, sweet veggies and flavor forward sauce.
 

 BBQ Roasted Salmon: fantastic fresh salmon with crispy skin was smothered with sweet BBQ sauce and served atop squash and crispy potato pieces and topped with fried onions and some fresh parsley. The BBQ sauce here is amazing. This was definitely one of the best dishes at the table.
 

 Pork Sandwich: a rather large Kaiser roll had a breaded pork cutlet and was topped with provolone cheese, giardiniera, and little tomato. This had almost no flavor - I would skip it.
 

 Pastrami Salmon Rachel: a thin housemade black sesame bagel was topped with smoked salmon, gruyere, country mustard, cabbage slaw, chopped egg and Russian dressing. While it was the most un-kosher deli sandwich, it was fantastic. The bagel was toasted and slightly crispy. The salmon was nice and smokey. The rich and tangy toppings added just the right crunch. Very good.
 

 We shared 3 desserts. The chocolate peanut butter pie was meh. It was basically an Oreo cookie crust with chocolate and peanut butter flavored fudge layers with whipped cream and peanut brittle. It was not very flavorful. The banana cream pie was pretty good - graham cracker crust was filled with custard and bananas and topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. It was very dense and rich and the second best banana cream pie that I have had. The best dessert that we had was the chocolate dauberge cake. It was a thin, long slice of the chocolate layer cake topped with malted chocolate balls, candied orange and malt whipped cream. It was a rich, chocolate cake with a light sponge and rich frosting, lovely sweet tangy accents and a little coffee flavor.

I know I ordered it knowing the price but I was hungry and they were open late. The thing that bothered me was that you can track the delivery and the time they estimated was way off. I asked for a no contact delivery and someone knocked on the door after midnight which woke my roommates.

In comparison to the King of Prussia location, I find this one to have a nicer and larger space, and I thought the entire ordering process was better organized. Just like the other location, the donuts I got were amazing. 
 

 The space is very open and clean. Menus can be found right when you walk in at the pick up counter (there is big, bold signage that will indicate where that is). Walk a little farther back to the cashier desk to place your order. They have a fair amount of tables and stools although all seats were occupied at the time that I went (7pm on a Saturday). A single donut starts at $1.45 a piece. 
 

 I placed an order for three donuts including cinnamon sugar with vanilla drizzle, lemon icing with raspberry drizzle, and vanilla icing with toffee crunch and salted caramel drizzle. Although they were all great, the last mentioned definitely impressed me the most. This hot and fresh donut was fluffy and very sweet, exactly how I like my donuts. What really stood out to me was the crunch. It was loaded with toffee and I got a nice crunch with every bite. It was like no other donut I've had before and I would definitely get it again.

 Pros - Really cool place with lots of seating room and a really great atmosphere. Staff was friendly and seemed well trained. Food service was spot on, we got everything we needed, when we needed it. 
 

 The food was prepared perfectly and was very tasty, with one exception, the ribs. 
 

 Cons - The ribs. If you are going to be a BBQ joint in the south, or anywhere for that matter, YOU HAVE TO GET THE RIBS RIGHT. For the most part they were, but the LARGE amount of LARGE chucks of salt and cracked pepper made my order nearly uneatable. They were beautiful visually, large ribs that were perfectly smoked (big red ring). The sauces were amazing and creative BUT, the rock salt and cracked pepper just ruined them.

A large group of us came here after church on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The entire restaurant is outdoors with spectacular views of the Delaware River and bridge. Near the entrance are long wood picnic tables alongside a wood paneled wall with pretty plants hanging down. I loved the casual and relaxed atmosphere. I also thoroughly enjoyed the live music while there! 
 

 We were allowed to sit anywhere we wanted and my group chose a spot more towards the middle at a high top table. 
 

 I noticed that they serve Adult Milkshakes which they can make virgin, which is perfect for me because I don't drink! I had a hard time deciding which kind to order, between the Salted Caramel, Mudslide & Orange Creamsicle. I finally chose the Salted Caramel which was absolutely delectable! It came with caramel sauce, pretzel stick and whipped cream. It had a strong flavor of caramel blended with tasty vanilla and was both creamy and thick. I would definitely get another milkshake next time. 
 

 As for the food, I decided to go for the Chicken Cheesesteak which I got with provolone cheese instead of cheese whiz. The sandwich comes with chips and they will not let you substitute fries... You have to order a side of fries which is $5. I ended up sharing fries with a friend. The sandwich came open faced, with the chicken in the middle, not quite filling up the whole sandwich. It did taste pretty good though... The chicken was well seasoned and tender, mingling well with the provolone. The fries came with a bit of a crisp, which is the way I liked it. Other orders of fries were more fluffy though. 
 

 Later, I saw an order of the Pier Ribs (which is under Snacks, but most certainly NOT snack-size... 3 full size ribs is a really great portion). Luckily my friend let me try it and it was great. The ribs were tender and flavorful, though I would have liked more sauce.
 

 The service was pretty good, but once the waitress left it was hard to find her and try to get her attention, so we just had to wait for her to return to our table. However, the waitress was very friendly and patient with me. 
 

 The other staff members were great too. At one point, I had left my to go back on one of the picnic tables by the door and when I went back it wasn't there anymore. I asked the hostess what happened to it and she wasn't sure but went to inquire about it and lo & behold, she was able to find it!

 We came on a Sunday, the place was packed as expected on a late Sunday morning. We were a party of two and were told it was a 25 minute wait, but we could seat ourselves at the bar for food service. Perfect! The bartender/server was very attentive and had a great energy. Anytime my husband and I brunch we get two entrees and something sweet for the middle. 
 

 While waiting it was cool to watch the bartenders serve up all these pretty coffee drinks. I would come back just to try one of them.
 

 We ordered the fried chicken Benedict, hash skillet with mushrooms, artichoke, spinach, sun dried tomatoes etc., and the blueberry lemon curd flapjack for the center of the table. Our sever asked if we knew how big the flapjack was...size of a hubcap he says. Well he didn't lie. Once we got our order it was gigantic portions all around. Presentation wise...Big WOW!! When it came down to taste we were a little let down. 
 

 Fried chicken Benedict came with huge chunk slices of tomato, bacon, spinach, mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and scrambled eggs, some sort of hot sauce that wasn't hollandaise, and we think sesame sticks sticking out of the dish (not even sure) Chicken was a bit over fried and dry, dense biscuit. The mashed potatoes were tasty, but overall it was way too much on the plate like 3 dishes in one. I don't really think it should even be considered a Benedict. I mean the eggs weren't even poached. 
 

 My skillet was nothing to rave about. I liked the potatoes and artichokes. I thought it tasted good, but I am not sure I would get it again. Biscuit was too dense, I didn't bother to eat it. 
 

 The blueberry lemon curd flapjack.. would have SO amazing if it were smaller and stacked with the lemon curd layered in between. This is one huge pancake. I could immediately smell the flour as I was putting it into my mouth. The texture of the pancake was kind of gummy rather than fluffy. Loved the lemon curd. It was drizzled over the pancake and wasn't too sweet. We didn't even use the syrup. Great flavor combo, just didn't work for me with its size. 
 

 Overall, there were definitely good components in each dish, but I'd personally rather have smaller portions of something executed super well than an oversized meal that's just okay.

 I heard some great things about CSS, so when I was in Creve Coeur at lunch time, I stopped by. Being a lone diner, as my usual, I choose to sit at the bar. Looking over the Signature Cocktail list, they had one of my favorites, Smokey Old Fashion. How could I resist? I should have. It was weak and bland with no smokey taste or garnish. However, I did like the water being served in a Cobalt Blue glass. 
 

 After reading the entrees, I choose their Mixed Grill, but was told it was sold out. They wouldn't have it until dinner, after they received their delivery. Bartender explained it was very popular and they sell out of it regularly. I then choose their Crispy Catfish Sandwich with Fries. 
 

 Since I was doing a sandwich and not a full entree, I decided to add an appetizer to my lunch. I was torn between the Crab Cakes and the Tempura Green Beans. I asked the bartender and she informed me the crab cakes were really good and were another of their most popular items. I went with the Green Beans, because I wanted a green veggie. 
 They were crisp and very lightly coated for a tempura item. The sweet and spicy sesame syrup served as a dipping sauce was delightful. 
 

 My crispy catfish was an extremely thin piece that was dominated by the bread. I did like the hot peppers as a topping to the catfish. When I choose the sea salt chips as my side the bartender informed me they no longer did them and it was fries. When I asked what type of fries, she replied, steak fries. I love steak fries, they're my favorite. So, I said yes to fries instead of the side salad. 
 

 Bartender needs to be educated on the difference in fries. When they arrived with my sandwich, they were Hand-Cut Fries. My second favorite, so I was to upset. However, some thick cut wedges of fries would have been nice. 
 

 Service was not that attentive. The bartender was busy talking with the manager on duty. She was friendly, but considering I was the only one at the bar and the restaurant only had three other tables, you'd think the service would be spot on. 
 

 They're new, I'm sure they'll overcome these little details and bumps.

I like how their pad see ew is made with more veggies than I typically get at Thai restaurants -- the dish was made with pan fried noodles in a dark soy/oyster sauce with broccoli, snow peas, and carrots. I wish it had Chinese broccoli instead of regular broccoli, but I can see that they're just trying to suit the tastes and preferences of customers in the area. My noodles were a little on the dry side, and they used the same type of noodles as my friend's drunken noodles, not the wider noodles I'm accustomed to for this dish.

Initially when I arrived, finding parking was a nightmare as there was also a drive through lane that cut through the parking lot. Once I got in, the QR code's for the menu were rubbed off on the table except for 1. This only made it mildly annoying to access the menu. I ended up ordering a burrito and my gf ordered a couple Sonoran dogs. The dogs were pretty good but I would say the burrito was about average. We waited awhile for our appetizer to come out initially which was a bit shocking since it was only chips and guac.

 Whew. Now, for the details:
 

 * Blood Marys: served in pint glasses (YAY!), not very spicy (even though we asked for spice), only $8! 
 

 * The BF had the fried green tomato benny, which looked awesome. Came with pimento cheese hollandaise (!) and a PILE of home fries. He was very happy.
 

 * I had a special - a savory waffle (with herbs & bacon in it), topped with sausage, scrambled eggs, and some cheese, and served with sausage gravy and maple syrup. Oh, AND home fries. Yeah. I managed to put away about half the waffle and eggs/cheese, a bite or two of fries, but I finished off the sausage & the gravy (with the BF's help!). Really interesting, unusual dish, and very tasty! (Didn't love the texture of the eggs - they were kind of heavy and cakey instead of soft and fluffy, but just a minor issue.)

 Verrelli's is located in a cute little strip mall in the back of a large private parking lot. Parking was ample and free around noon on a Wednesday, which was an added bonus!!

 My uncle-in-law said it best. This is the type of place you wanna take out of towners to. He should know...he is an out of towner.
 

 We went to three places that night. The first place didn't have cod during the week, only on Fridays. The second place probably had cod...but they also had a packed house and I am not gonna be a statistic just to eat at a restaurant. If there is a wait....there is just too many people,
 

 But then we realized we could take old UIL to Smee's, for they are FAMOUS for what he wanted. And we could also try them out in their not so new brick and mortar location.
 

 They had customers but they were well distanced. So we stayed and got some of the most heavenly fried cod you have ever tasted. It was sizable chunks of fish fried perfectly. Did I say perfectly in a hyperbolic way? No, I MEAN perfect. We got the 7 piece for the wife and I to share. A bowl of fish chunks were set in front of us, and we took our time savoring every bite...and when we were done, there was a lovely sight. A bowl. A basically empty bowl. I expected it to be full of the oil that the fish was cooked in. But nothing. It was amazing. No sopping up cooking oil from our fingers and our lips and our face. Just fantastic tasting cod. Not to say that we didn't also gobble down the cod with fish sauce and tartar and vinegar and fries and coleslaw. But the star of the evening was the cod.
 

 The service was on point if a little distracted with all of the covid stuff they have to do. The interior was not quite to upscale date level. But it was still nice.
 

 This place is a local gem that really is something unique...especially in our land locked location, you probably could even win a bet or two taking friends here and betting them that this will be the best cod they have ever had.

Even though I have lived in Tampa for most of my life, but this was my first experience at Berns.
 

 Are they expensive? Yes, But no more so than any other high end steak house in the area. I chose the Porterhouse Steak, not because I was hungry (I was), but because I wanted to savor every moment of the experience. 
 

 What is different here is that the sides are not à la cart. Instead, Berns provides an offering of staples that include French Onion Soup, baked potato and a house salad. In honesty, the French Onion Soup was excellent while the salad was surprisingly underwhelming. The potato was kind of dry and the vegetables were laughably minuscule, but the real star of the show was the meat.

Funny how I bookmarked a few options to grab a late meal on Yelp- & I don't recall stumbling on Walk On's prior to our visit. But! Driving past it on the way to our hotel- I bookmarked it while in the taxi!
 So, first off- thanks to the neon sign! I didn't really want to visit a chain restaurant... especially if it's a place I can eat at if I'm back in San Diego.
 Luckily for us, Walk On's is less than 5 minutes walking distance from our hotel!
 Hostess said there was a 30 minute wait, but, revised it to 20 minutes. It didn't seem that long- thank goodness time seemed to go a bit faster. Just listening & feeling the rumble in my belly wasn't helping out much. And, as much as I do get impatient- I was chill last night. 
 Perhaps because while we waited at our seats- I read some of the Yelp reviews. This lead me to one thing- 
 Know my food order once we place our beverage order! Especially this late at night- I don't have time for dilly dally.
 Appetizer- Fried Alligator w/ creamy horseradish sauce. First time having alligator & what an experience! Delicious chunks of white meat. Not super dry. But, tender! Great pairing w/ the horseradish! The breading was light & crispy! 
 

 Bayou Pasta- linguine pasta served with a HEAP of fried breaded shrimp- made to order breaded & fried shrimp! It has to be. You can tell if it's the breaded & frozen kind of shrimp. And you don't get that quality here. Underneath the heap of shrimp- there was CRAWFISH tails! My gosh! Both the crawfish & shrimp were fresh! You can taste the freshness in ever bite! I felt like I was biting into the ocean! Mixed in w/ that savory crawfish cream sauce! Yes! Mix & merry all of that fried shrimp in that creamy crawfish sauce & swirl that linguini pasta too! I couldn't even eat the half order of garlic bread that came w/ my dish! Hubby said it had some kick to it. Then again- I pointed to the crushed red chili flakes on it. What a great twist on garlic bread!
 Hubby ordered the Chicken Advocado Sandwich. Served w/ a generous portion of waffle fries! He said he didn't expect to see TWO portions of chicken meat in his sandwich! He literally had to put one portion of the chicken meat on the plate because it was too much food! He enjoyed the meal though!
  I did order the Krispy Kreme bread pudding to go. So, I can't wait to see how it tastes! 
 Lamika was our server for the night. She was cheery, kind, & attentive. The girls looked cute in their cheerleader uniforms.

The shrimp were overcooked and didn't have much flavor because the broth sucked it up. The thai chicken lettuce wraps were salted and didnt really have any elements of typical thai flavors.
 

 For dessert I had the brownie and it was extremely dry and I could tell it was slightly burnt. They also forgot to put caramel sauce on mine.

442313,hsEqs1izK0vLCK2G0vy68w,"I have attempted to eat here multiple times, but every time they were closed. My 1st try was on their opening weekend and they ran out of bread & several other times they were just closed. They close pretty early (like before 9pm, even on weekends). Finally, I had the opportunity to give them a try this past week. My family ordered the following:
 

 Bacon Cheddar Cheesesteak (Large)
 No onions
 Original Cheesesteak (regular)
 No onions or peppers
 Hamburger
 Kids meal with a turkey & provolone 
 With mayo, mustard, & dressing
 Lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickle. 
 Large French fries 
 

 So, here's the positives. The store was very clean. The employees were very nice and it didn't take long to actually get my food. They weren't crowded when I arrived. It seemed like they were making my food fresh, but.....more on that later. Anyhow, they also had a decent selection of condiments to take home with the food. 
 

 The not so good (Bad isn't the right word)
 The prices are high for what you get. When paying $10 for a sandwich I kinda expect to get more than I got. The sandwiches did not have much in the way of steak or cheese. I would estimate my large sandwich had around 1/2 cup of meat and 1 piece of cheese that had been cut in half. The regular Cheesesteak had about a 1/4 cup of meat. The meat was VERY CHOPPED and didn't have much texture left, except for pieces of fat. The cheese was also lacking. They don't use any sort of cheese sauce so the sandwich seemed a bit dry. The meat to bread ratio definitely was mostly bread. The cheese wasn't quite melted, it was in that in between state where it wants to melt but it just ended up coagulated. The ""large"" crinkle cut fries were a bit small for the price & were not hot. The burger was not worth $5! The burger was the only item that was served hot. I believe that is probably what they were cooking. It was a thin patty with standard veggies & sauce. The sandwich for the kids meal was a decent size. It was actually heavier than the $10 Cheesesteak sandwich! The only negative on it was they forgot to add the mayo, mustard, & dressing, so it was a bit dry.  
 I really wanted to love the food here. I don't know if I will actually come back unless there is some sort of coupon or special.  I spent just under $40. If the food had been worth it, I would never complain about price, but it just wasn't worth the money.",0,1,0,-1,1,1,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0

 I'm not going to go into crazy detail about the food but he's my brief set of tips for future visitors. Don't fill up on the salad bar. One plate that isn't filled to the edges. The house sirloin is probably my favorite cut of meat. If you like meat close to well done, you're going to have issues getting that without them running to the back to specifically cook yours longer, but they will do that for you. Most cuts are medium-rare to medium. Sign up for their emails to get all types of discounts. You can get multiple at one time and use two on a visit. Lunch is a great way to do Fogo and save money. And for dessert get the papaya cream. If you go for your birthday, you'll get it for free. And look out for restaurant week/month specials as well.

 After quite some time spent on social media following their insta I was able to learn how and more importantly when to reserve a slot for a pie correctly.

When your reservation is at 7:00 p.m., and food is ordered by 8:00 p.m., yet your entrees don't show up until after 9:00 p.m. and service doesn't bother to accommodate your table, you have a real problem with lack of staffing or lack of training with your FOH team. I recommended this place as a location to celebrate my friend's birthday, since I liked the restaurant the last time I was here. My friend already had a rough birthday week, and let's just say that this restaurant experience did nothing but add to the frustration. There were 7 plus a toddler in our party, and only a couple of people ordered starters. One of my friends and I decided to split the foie terrine, the moules frites, and the trout amandine. We appreciated that they split the foie appetizer into two plates for us, something we didn't ask for but received as a pleasant surprise. We thought that service would be impeccable from there, but we were proven wrong. At 9:00 p.m., we had to flag the manager over to explain that we've waited a very long time for our entrees to arrive, and we saw that tables that were seated after us received their entrees. The manager was apologetic and comped all of our desserts. However, even that took an extremely long time to come out, and as mentioned, we had a toddler in our party who was very patient and well-behaved, but even she has her limits and it was way past her bedtime. 
 

 Once the bill came, our server suddenly became attentive and hovered over us to the point where it was uncomfortable. We split the bill into a couple of cards and one of our friends left cash. The cash did not come back to us - we were still determining the tip total and our server gave us attitude and told us that she would have had to take the money out of her purse. Okay - rookie move. I used to work in the restaurant business and grew up in the restaurant business a la my parents. You never assume that any cash should be left as a tip. Change must always go back to the party. We did not appreciate the inattentiveness or the attitude for that matter, and it is unfortunate, because the entrees were pretty decent. Not everyone enjoyed their meal, partially due to the time it took for the meals to come out. I will say that the mussels had a wonderful flavor, but the fries were tiny and hard to eat. One of our friends ended up cancelling a side order because it was forgotten about - yet another mishap. We ordered a bunch of comped desserts - which took a long time for whatever reason - another mystery. My dessert took the longest to arrive and it was a rendition of an Il flottante (floating island). I was baffled by this dessert - a traditional il flottante is made up of meringue in a pool of creme anglaise. What I received was vanilla ice cream over a citrusy sauce topped with a teeny tiny meringue foam.

 The love affair started a few years ago when I was at The HUB restaurant and tasted their ice cream. Since then, I've had multiple flavors at both the restaurant and the ice cream factory and loved most of them. Last night was Orange Blossom Pistachio - YUM
 

 Employees are always very friendly and greet you with a warm smile. They don't mind letting you taste various flavors so you can pick which one you want to buy. The interior of the factory is really cute and clean.
 

 Bonus customer service last night. My guy and I wanted ice cream in a waffle cone so we tasted several flavors and finally each placed our order. But sadly, they were out of waffle cones!!! For some reason, the waffle cone was the draw last night and the ice cream secondary so we were pretty disappointed. My guy asked if since there were no waffle cones, if we could just get the kids size each. **Sign on the wall clearly states that the kids size is for kids 12 and under. No problem!

  ---  ---  ---
 

 I can't believe it took me this long to visit! The wife and I love grilled cheese concepts about as much as we like anything in life, so I'm really shocked that this one slipped through the cracks. I don't go to Westshore Mall very often but I recently dropped someone off at the airport and figured I'd hop on over.
 

 Mall food courts are generally filled with the same 6-8 fast food restaurants that you'll find in just about any other mall in America. I can't remember how long it's been since I was excited to eat at a food court, but that streak is now officially broken. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a local business offering something a bit different than the norm in this setting.
 

 First off, when I walked up, the customer service was definitely several notches above what you'd expect... again, at a food court. The vibe I got was that these were actually the owners, which would have made a lot of sense as to why they were so friendly. I also visited at around 10:30a when the entire food court had maybe 3 other customers in it, but still, it was obvious that these guys were genuinely happy to have me as a patron.
 

 As for the food, as soon as I saw the Hawaiian Melt on the menu, I knew I had to have it. Swiss, mozzarella, ham, bacon, pineapple and bbq? Sign me up for a lifetime supply. This sandwich was simple and a bit small, but as delicious as I would have hoped for.
 

 I also ordered a strawberry/banana smoothie, which really hit the spot and made my meal seem more breakfast-y, which was appropriate considering the timeframe of my early visit.
 

 All in all, I probably won't ever eat at Westshore Mall again outside of Planet Grilled Cheese. If we see other food trucks opening up kiosks at the food courts around town, we'll know it was a success.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

 First off a few things. One, it's an extremely small restaurant. Like really small! That not a bad thing but just be aware. Second the place seems very dirty and smells like smoke. I won't point out specifics but look around. Now, I will focus on the food.
 

 We started with the eggplant caprese. That was the highlight of our meal. It was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The crunch was fanatic with the soft fresh mozzarella. It was almost a perfect appetizer. It did have a bit too much garlic and oregano for our liking. For entrees my wife went with the Sinatra and I went with the chicken parmigiana. Both entrees came with a house salad. The salad was fresh but boring. It was just lettuce, tomato and 1 cucumber. The vinegarette was watered down and also lacked flavor. Now I'm not Italian and I don't claim to be an Italian food expert. The food just wasn't anything to blow us away. My chicken parmigiana was good, not great. The sauce was very good and had the right acidity. The chicken was also very soggy on the bottom. Neither dish had fresh pasta, it was boxed. The Sinatra was a good idea but lacked in execution. The sauce while good was too thick and heavy. There were a nice amount of shrimp though. At $25 it was way overpriced. 2 stars all night long",0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,0,-1,0

 The customer service is awesome. You feel like friends the moment you start ordering. Stacey tries to learn everyone's names, how they learned of the place, and what connections they have to the building. After 5-10 min upon receiving your food, the staff came around and asked if we needed anything else and whether we were enjoying our food.
 

 Generous portions - You could easily have leftovers for later. During my 3PM visit, the guy in front of me saw his sandwich and said ""I'm going to need a to-go box, too."" It's at least 25-30% larger than any of the chain stores' sandwiches.
 

 Awesome sandwich - I had the french dip, and this was the 1st time that I can remember that I didn't need au jus. The meat was tender and flavorful. The melted cheese complimented the meat, and I just let it sit on my tongue for an extra minute to enjoy that taste.
 

 As Johnny points out, the price point might not be for everyone. Sandwich with chips and beverage will run you $13-15, but if you split the sandwich into 2 meals (definitely do-able) and value that personalized customer service experience, I see this place as part of my Nashville favorites.

For the main rolls, we ordered Rooster Salmon, spider roll, and alligator rolls.

The pizza has gotten extremely greasy and the last two times they screwed up my order. I didn't say anything the first time they gave me pepperoni instead of bacon. Don't order the pineapple topping... it tastes like it is from a can and they don't warm it on the pizza. Gross. I ordered a calzone which says it comes with ham on the menu but I got cheese only. When I called to complain I was told they couldn't remake it and that it was my mistake for not specifying the ham. They also challenged me being a former customer saying it was my first order. It was the first time I used the online ordering system. 
 

 The calzone was mostly dough and their large side of sauce is tiny. My $50 order for a family of 5 wasn't worth it.

 Pros: Nice ambiance, the waitress was very nice, and the fried goat cheese salad was really good (would've been nice if the salad was tossed, then the goat cheese placed on top). The fries are crispy.
 

 Cons: The other dishes I ordered, the chicken souvlaki sandwich and the fish tacos, were not good. The sandwich had no flavor and the chicken's consistency was off. The fish tacos were confusing. The fish was a little crispy and charred but was also sweet which threw the whole taco off. The waitress said this was spicy, but it wasn't, at all. The pico de gallo was mushy and flavorless, and there was a giant piece of avocado and that was basically the whole taco.
 

 My stomach hurt when I got home.
 

 Advice: Make your fish tacos more savory - not sweet. Add salt. Rejuvenate the pico and add corn to the mix. Instead of avocado, make it guacamole, or dice up the avocados. Redo the souvlaki sandwich.",0,0,-1,0,0,1,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0

 The first time I came here I ordered the lamb platter with pita, carrots, hummus, and fried eggplant. The lamb was very flavorful and juicy. It was definitely a favorite. I also really like how the pita is warm when they serve it, and the hummus taste fresh especially with the olive oil drizzle. The carrots were OK, I just don't like the boiled, soggy carrot texture. However, the fried eggplant, let me tell you, was the bomb.com. It was perfectly crisp and thin to soak all the flavors in. Some other sides I like are the cabbage and the mix of tomatoes and cucumbers. They add the light vinegar taste that enhances the flavors of the meat. I also enjoy the chicken shawarma, which is very delicious shredded chicken. The chicken kabob is more like chunks of grilled chicken thigh, if you're more into that. The beef kebab is my least favorite because it is more on the dry side. Definitely get a lot of tahini. It adds that extra taste of creaminess.

The space is just beautiful; lots of white tile, gentle wood accents, and just a very crisp and clean feeling about it. It's an open kitchen, so you can see the magic being made. 
 

 They serve Crema coffee, and it was outstanding. We had a large format mimosa; they use fresh squeezed orange juice, it was perfect. I probably drank too much of it because it tasted so good and refreshing. 
 

 The restaurant encourages groups to order family-style, although you don't have to. We chose to do that, and I am so glad that we did because I got to taste so many amazing dishes. We had the Monkey Bread and Pastry Basket. I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet things for breakfast, but these were exceptional. The pastry basket had a Thai iced tea donut (it actually tasted like Thai iced tea, amazing), a strawberry pop tart, and lemon polenta cake. Very moist and flavorful. 
 

 I had a few oysters, including the Kumamoto, my absolute all-time favorite. They were fresh and ever so tasty. I just about melted into my seat with sheer pleasure.
 

 Without going into great detail, because this review would be a novel, we had the following dishes: White Shrimp Salad (my choice, and it was incredible), Field Pea Toast (way better than I thought it would be, really interesting flavors), Breakfast Sandwich, Pancakes, Cured Salmon Bialy, and Huevos Rancheros. I can't even decide which are my favorites. Nothing was mediocre; it was all top notch.

Anyways, my girlfriend and I came here for our Friday date night around 7:15pm and the place was packed. There was literally no parking at the restaurant, so we had to park at the place next door and pray for the car not to get towed. The owner was really nice and had us seated at our table after about a 25 minute wait. Pro tip: the adjacent tables at the restaurant are extremely close together, so if you want a more intimate setting, you'll have to eat at a different restaurant. Anyways, after being seated, my girlfriend and I were starving and waited over 20 minutes just for a waitress to take our order, but she never came to our table. Therefore, I went over to the owner and talked to him and luckily he took our order. After our order was taken, the food came out pretty quickly and overall, it was legitimately good thai food for the price we paid. For drinks, we ordered the thai iced tea with milk. It was amazing and not too sweet! Unfortunately, they don't offer free refills, so if you want more thai tea, you have to shell out another $3. However, Friday night is a great night for curry because they serve red curry (my girlfriend's favorite). The red curry came with a large portion of chicken, cucumber, zucchini, red curry sauce, and jasmine rice. The red curry was not too spicy and was well complemented with the assorted vegetables. We also ordered the Pad Kra Pao and fresh rice paper rolls. We chose pork for the meat for the Pad Kra Pao and the dish was quite underwhelming. There was a good portion of meat, but the Pad Kra Pao did not have much flavor or taste besides being spicy. Luckily the fresh rice paper rolls were amazing. I highly recommend getting two orders of them because they have several kinds of assorted vegetables and they come with an excellent sweet & sour sauce. Lastly, we finished dinner with the sticky rice and mango. According to my girlfriend, this was the dish of the night. The sticky rice and mango came with a real mango slice and the sticky rice was not overwhelmingly sweet and was the perfect thickness and texture to end the meal.

 On 10/8/20, I went to visit OTG for the second time with my friend TJ. We ordered the Pesto Veggie (Spinach, red onion, mushrooms, black olives and peppadew) and the Meat & 'Shroom (homemade sausage, pepperoni and roasted mushroom). Both were excellent!
 

 One of the things that I loved about the Pesto Veggie was the pesto was not applied too heavily, which allowed the other flavors to shine through. The fresh basil on top was a nice touch, both visually and flavor wise. And I LOVED the addition of Peppadew. Though I had heard of these peppers before, this was my first time trying them. They have been on my radar ever since Brad Wegelin shared a picture of his special order OTG Pizza, the P&P (Pepperoni & Peppadew) on his Instagram twozeroate.

 For those who unfamiliar with Peppadew, It is a trademarked brand name for a South African company that is best known for a pickled version of the Juanita pepper, which a sweet piquante pepper grown in the Limpopo province of South Africa. Sometimes described as a cross between a pepper and a tomato, Peppadews have a nice amount of heat.

 1) Parking sucks ... especially if you go at lunchtime during the week like I did.
 

 2) Be prepared to wait in a long, winding line that stretches out the door.
 

 3) Have your order straight in your mind before you reach the cashier; lots of hungry customers are going to be pretty upset if you're still trying to figure it out when you get to the front.
 

 4) You're going to be panicked when you get inside because you're going to swear that there's not going to be a table for you, but rest assured that you will (just as the signs say). The dining area is deceptively large.
 

 5) The owner seems like a really nice guy. He walks around and checks on the patrons and fixes anything you/he finds displeasing.
 

 6) Dudes ... they sprinkle brown sugar on the sweet potato fries. I would come back time and time again just for those stinkin' fries, man.

We went here on a Saturday night and as usual it was about a 30 minute wait. Keep your eye out though the bar area has tables that become available and you can sit yourself. We got a booth and Amanda was our waitress. She has worked there for 4 years now, and just went part time because she moved far away. I have always wanted to try the chicken udon noodles it has a spicy peanut sauce, but not too spicy, and the new watermelon cocktail which was so refreshing and delicious. My other have had their season special which was the peppercorn top sirloin cooked perfect at a medium temperature. I was reluctant on getting the steak because normal it shrinks and comes out like a flat pancake at other restaurants. This was the most tender steak it tasted like butter. I found out they steam the steak for 24 or 48 hours I can't remember and then cook it. They have a manager in the kitchen that checks each order before it goes out to the dining area. I was sitting close to the kitchen so I was able to see that. I spoke to the manager Kalie about how much better my experience was and what a difference from one visit to the next. After speaking with him he is very passionate about his restaurant, working for BJ, his customers and staff. They are very fortunate to have a manager that cares so much about what he is doing on a day to day basis. I will definitely be back to get that steak. The peppercorn is not spicy at all.

 So I know that there are a few reviews that note a lack of service or rude service. I didn't find that to be the case. I think that some don't recognize Philly personality and it often comes across as being rude when t's just Philly. 
 

 We stopped in for lunch while we were shopping @ the Italian market. Had to come back because they opened at noon on Saturday. We sat at the bar. FYI if you are more than 4-5 in your group and you want to come in and eat, you gotta get a table. You may not sit at the bar. If you walk in to the bar side and want a table you have to walk further into the restaurant. Don't just stand at the bar. They will point you (very directly to the back to get a table). Again don't think of this as rude - think of it as a classic Philly experience. 
 

 Anyway we had the special (shrimp & scallops in red sauce) and the spaghetti and meatballs. We thoroughly enjoyed both. The special was perfectly balanced and would highly recommend. We ate a perfect Sunday gravy (aka spaghetti sauce). It was a stick to your bones meal that we were craving. 
 

 Stop in and soak it all in. Bring your cash (it's a Philly thing- get over it) and your appetite cause you'll enjoy this mom & pop shop in the middle of the market.

 - Gnocchi with octopus, mussels, and shrimp

 We arrived and they stated that all reservations were lagging 15 minutes behind, so we loitered around in the lounge upstairs. I had a mocktail- the ginger ale was flat. South Pacific mocktail is delicious, tastes just like the Carribbean and the Rejuvenation mocktail is tart but good too. Lounge was small, but comfy.
 

 That phallus shaped lamp that is unable to be moved on the dinner table is just a questionable design choice. The waitress we had was great albeit a new employee (she couldn't describe what fish we were eating besides the crab, tuna, and salmon), we ordered the cha-soba, dobin mushi soup, and the $90 chef selection for two with no eel and octopus.
 

 Morimoto PA's rice was dry. Perhaps it was because it was around closing but it was just agonizing to eat the dry rice especially since I love sushi.
 

 It just bothers me that the prices in Morimoto PA was the same as the NYC counterpart when everything from the service and the food was so lacking, plus Philadelphia being such a cheap city in comparison to NYC.
 

 A quick guide to ordering at Morimoto for two:
 - First time here or want to impress your date? 
 Splurge on the toro board that everybody gets. It makes a good pic but spending more than $30 on a blended fish (oops, I mean *tartare*) on a board isn't for me. Cutely spar with your date with the mini shovels they provide for the last bite.
 - Most bang for your buck? 
 Get the cha-soba and dobin mushi, tell the waiter to spilt each into two, entertain your date and show how cultured you are as to how to eat the cha-soba (season the soup with wasabi, sesame seeds, and onion, dip noodles and eat). After the noodles, the soup in the teapot would have cooled. Pour it out into the mini espresso cups and sip while waiting for the next course. You will be instructed to fish the shrimp/mushrooms out from the teapot and eat them. Unsexy. Do not do that.
 - Spilt the $90 chef's combination sushi, sushi rolls and sashimi, or go with the $45 and get an entree each if you are really hungry.",0,1,0,0,-1,1,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0
68560,Ai0YMErKj0aNoLSeTfjknA,"Been wanting to try this place ever since the bourse opened but was unfortunately very hungover the first time I went and opted for something more nausea friendly instead.
 

 Finally came back and made it a point to get some food from LALO. I got the bas-ka-bob over rice with a soft boiled egg and lumpia add ons. Also got the calamansi drink and the leche flan.
 

 I have to give them props for the cute and different plating. The leche flan came on a wooden looking paper plate with a banana leaf underneath, bringing even more of the culture into the dish.
 

 I really enjoyed the bas-is-bob dish. Being Vietnamese, I really appreciate a solid meat and rice dish with pickled veggies on the side. The chicken was very flavorful and nothing I had was too greasy, including the lumpia. The lumpia were pretty small but tasty. Wish they were a bit longer. Then the leche flan tasted good but was a pretty thick consistency which I'm not used to with other flans so that comes down to a personal preference.
 

 I think LALO has a lot to offer, especially since filipino food is not very common amongst the restaurant scene. For what it is and how much you get though, I think it's a bit overpriced. This might be a general trend in the bourse (maybe rent is high?) but that would be my only qualm.

 His baked potato arrived stacked with sour cream, and I haven't decided if my ""whipped"" potatoes were rotten/soured, or just drowned in sour cream. The lobster was shit quality, to be frank, and cooked twice as long as it should have been. 
 We took maybe three bites and declared defeat. The owner came to the table and asked about the meal, and we explained all of the above in a very respectful manner.

 2. Ambiance and decor is A+ for this lil joint. 
 

 Cons
 

 1. Spotty service--we sat outside and we're never acknowledged, we sat inside and had to bring attention to ourselves to be acknowledged, and then they forgot some of our items...
 

 2. The frosé is absolute....sorry.....it's TRASH. Don't call a lemonade slushee frosé (it wasn't even slightly pink, and it tasted non-alcoholic). At the very least don't charge $7 for a tiny glass of it. To be fair, the server did warn that it basically tasted like lemonade...I guess I just hoped for the best. I didn't imagine they would call it frosé if it wasn't.

The bartender was wonderful she was very attentive and helped recommend great features of the restaurant. I decided to order the cup of seafood gumbo and half fried oysters/half fried shrimp poor boy w a side of jalapeño hush puppies!!! 
 The gumbo was thick roux with good helping of veggies and seafood. And nice scoop of rice but not to much and I liked the claw served on top. It was very mild not to spicy and a perfect portion for lunch w a sandwich.
 The poor boy arrived w a side of fries instead of hush puppies and the bartender immediately had it replaced with the correct within a minute. The poor boy was delicious never having fried oysters these were a treat and the shrimp both had a great salty crisp batter. The sauce was perfect to the seafood, the bread was soft and toppings fresh. I could only finish half the bread but finished all my seafood bc it was so tasty could not pass. The french fries were french fries I would definitely trade out for hush puppies or something else they are known for. I finished every hush puppy they were delicious.

 This restaurant and cafe duo is located in a plaza east of Old Town, close to where the car dealerships are. Parking is decent, it might be hard to get a close spot during busy hours but there's plenty of space. The right side is Phresh Teas where you can order food to-go, socialize with friends, and play board games. You'll want to enter through the doors on the left for Uniboil. Both businesses are owned by the same person, as well as Vons Chicken, Kaiju, and Su's Bowl near UCSB. Drink/snacks are the same as Phresh, I sometimes order milk tea with my hot pot.
 

 There's other menu items like teppanyaki and noodle soups, but I go with the Build-Your-Own hot soup. You first choose a soup base depending on your spice tolerance and preference. Next, you select the protein you want in your pot. They have beef, lamb shoulder, pork, seafood, and vegetarian. The menu also lists the different ingredients that come with each option. I get the angus beef, which has cabbage, tofu, imitation crab, fish cake, corn, and a variety of other yummy things. The third step is side orders, where you choose rice or noodles. I like udon and additional imitation crab, which is a couple bucks extra.
 

 Hot pot is traditionally a communal dish, something do with a group of people around the dinner table. But I like the individual pot because everyone has different preferences when it comes to taste. For newcomers, it's a cool concept. For old-timers, Unibowl does a pretty good job matching other restaurants like Boiling Point and Jazz Cat.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 Our experience here was perfect, from ordering to post-meal. We opted for a biscuit to split as an appetizer, and I was floored by the consistency and flavor- it was perfectly soft and the butter included made it a slam dunk. We both went with the tenders meal; I opted for General Tso (it stuck out as unusual so I went for it), and there is a heat level for everyone. The chicken was cooked well, and was fresh and juicy. I was pleasantly surprised by the General Tso sauce. It was sweet to my liking and complemented the chicken well. I also had fries, which were crispy, and my favorite, the mac and cheese casserole, rounded out my meal. I highly recommend the mac and cheese as a side; Southern adds a unique twist and the different flavors add dimension, and it's not like anything i've had before.

258933,jiIs9CmOvJBBhDb5yEqTFw,"Based on the reviews I was excited to eat here. Maybe tonight was just an off night but my food was not what I expected. So, to start we had the Parmesan garlic butter oysters and the Rockefeller oysters. The Rockefeller oysters were delicious, I loved those and such a different combination- the parmesan garlic butter ones were mediocre at best, not a fan. I've had way better at other places. For out entrees we ordered the ribeye steak (medium) and the yellowfin tuna. After the long wait they finally bring out our food and it's cold as if it was sitting out for a while. I hate sending food back, but this was just not acceptable and for what you are paying I'd at least expect warm food. Also when I ordered the yellowfin I asked to replace the fried rice with mashed potatoes and they still brought out fried rice. Once they took the food back, they were apologetic and tried to give us the reason why it may have been cold, but in the restaurant business, you should never serve food that's cold or not something you would eat personally so I wasn't really interested in the excuse but it was nice they tried. When they brought out the 2nd plates, my tune was barely seasoned - not good at all and almost seemed like it was rushed to be brought out so they didn't cook it as long. The steak was supposed to be medium well and it was borderline raw. I understand trying to rush to get out food back out to us, but I'd rather waited a little longer to get quality food. I can say while we waited they did offer us bread which was also appreciated. I was offered wine, I don't drink, but turned it down. For our inconvenience we were offered a desert and chose the fried cheesecake- that was the best thing all night. It was perfect cheesecake and the crust outside was delicious. As of right now, I can't say this is a place I would come back to eat. Our waitress Allie was awesome and very empathetic. She was probably the reason we stayed. Maybe I'll try it again another time and day, but it won't be any time soon. Tip to the restaurant, if the food has been sitting out and and your not able to serve fresh cooked food, then just try the meal again, don't serve the meal just recook it.

 I had the bourbon salmon served with rice pilaf and spinach and love love loved it!! Very tender salmon with just a little flavor, yum! Rice could have been a touch more tender, but I should complain, and spinach was fantastic. 
 Another had the fish and chips. Very crispy outer and tender fish. Tasty. Served with broccoli. Good amount of broccoli and cooked just enough, still slight crunch. 
 Kids meals of sliders with mandarins - not bad, Burger slightly dry. Kids meal of chicken tenders and fries - juicy tenders. I would like to see the option (without extra cost) to have a veggie in addition to kids meal with side of fries or mandarins. I fed my kids some of my spinach and another's extra broccoli. 
 Appetizers of pot stickers and also the Brussel sprouts. Pot stickers were good but had to be dipped in soy sauce... it who doesn't! And the Brussel sprouts were very interesting and tasty!

We were super hungry and had decided what we'd wanted before hand so we didn't take long. The servers checked on us from time to time, and made sure we were okay. Even the manager, Nick, made table touches within the first 15 mins of our sitting down, and then met with us later before we left. The food was excellent, and the drink that we ordered was very refreshing as well. Let's talk about the food.
 

 Edamame Hummus - I generally love hummus, but I loved this even more because the edamame made the taste lighter and more refreshing. Scooping this delicious appetizer with fried wonton wrappers lightly seasoned with salt and pepper was the perfect bite!
 

 Spicy Butterfly Roll - Beware! This roll IS spicy! But oh so yummy. The asparagus gives it a nice crunch, while the spicy sesame oil gives it a nice kick.
 

 Seafood Fried Rice - the seafood fried rice was super yummy to me. Savory, yet sweet, I really loved the addition of mushrooms and cucumber to this simple staple rice dish! 
 

 Madame Butterfly (cocktail) - the drink was sweet, fragrant and simply delicious. But one must be careful, since it tastes so good, it's very easy to drink one too many of these saccharine concoctions and then find yourself in all kinds of trouble.

With that said, we both were very pleased with our burgers. Ordered and delivered to our table while the bun was still warm! I ordered a double patty and he ordered a triple. You get your choice of toppings and sauce, with additional costs if you get things like mushrooms (+ $.50) or bacon (+ $1.00). The sides are a la carte ($4.00).

I will say it did make the Baby's pink, neon sign stand out above the bar area as we drove up in front. It's a much more modern twist to the 50's type diner, but just not as bright and vibrant as I had envisioned prior to my visit. The bar area was fun to look at while the rest of the restaurant was a little bit more standard.

179774,1NoKdB1vJ-Z81yoBtNMlWg,"tl;dr this no-frills hole-in-the-wall in Point Breeze cooks up authentic, delicious Indonesian fare
 

 With only an unassuming sign and bright yellow door to indicate that they even exist within their residential neighborhood, Hardena is a prime hole-in-the-wall. Open up the front door to immediately be greeted by aromas of spices and stews, making your stomach grumble before even making it to the counter. Rolling chairs and gaudy tablecloths are crammed into the tiny space, while cultural ornaments line the bright orange walls.
 

 On a Sunday at 6:30PM, Hardena had a short line, but each of the few seats was taken. My partner ordered from the counter, while I scoped out seats when they became available. The woman behind the counter helpful in explaining all of the items while we ordered. 
 

 My partner and I shared the Rijsttafel Plate, an 8 item combo platter wit sides of chicken satay, krupuk (deep fried rice crackers), and jasmine rice. Within 15 minutes of ordering, an enormous plate, lined with banana leaves, was carried out to our table. The satays were the best I've had in Philly, freshly cooked in a thick, rich peanut sauce. The rice had a sticky rice texture and was topped with a scoop of fried garlic. For our items, we chose the Jackfruit Stew, Beef Rendang, Chicken Rendang, Goat Curry, Fish Curry, Tofu Curry, Vegetable Stew, and Vegetable Fritter. The jackfruit was a unique experience, with a rich, sour flavor and pulled pork-like texture. It would've been my favorite dish of the night, but was closer to warm than hot by the time I got to it. The beef rendang was stewed in coconut milk and Indonesian spices, melting in my mouth with every delicious bite. The chicken was marinated similar to the beef; while it was well-cooked and tender, the beef rendang outclassed it in most every way. The goat wasn't served with sauce, but the distinctive flavor of goat more than made up for it. The fish and tofu curries both were served in a yellow sauce. I think the contrasting flavors and flakiness of the fish really took the yellow curry to the next level. Vegetable stew was falling apart in my mouth, clearly simmered in the fragrant broth for a long time. The fritter successfully managed to have a crispy outside and soft inside, but unfortunately was only lukewarm. We also got an Es Teler, a bright pink fruit cocktail that included longan, rambutan, papaya, palm fruit, and jackfruit mixed with sweet coconut milk. This was more of a dessert than a beverage, and was the perfect way to top off our great meal. When I go back (which hopefully will be sooner rather than later), I will get the Jackfruit, Beef Rendang, Goat Curry, and / or Fish Curry. As a heads up, the jackfruit and goat are only available on weekends.

 ""You can get a sandwich anywhere"" others will exclaim!! 
 

 But my question to you is... would you drive an hour for a foot long at Subway or a large sub at Quiznos? What about the Giant sub at Jersey Mikes??? I didn't think so. 
 

 Well this Saturday, I specifically got In my car and drove to beautiful Montecito to get my sandwich and then drove over to the beach by Santa Barbara City College and went to town on my #11. =) 
 

 So what makes Panino so special you ask? It's the fact that they are a small mom and pop sandwich spot with 6 locations all within Santa Barbara County. This allows for the ingredients to stay fresh and to have consistency across the board. 
 

 I first fell in love with Panino in Los Olivos, but discovered this location was even closer to my home and have made this hour drive on a few different occasions since then to reminisce this beautiful sandwich spot all made with that Santa Barbara County Love.

637247,Fud7w0MC4sEtngP-FYA51A,"We came to Tucson for the 4th Avenue Street Fair and wanted lodging that wasn't your typical chain. I prepaid for a room through one of the booking sites and check-in was fairly smooth.  Ivonne noted she was going to give us a complimentary upgrade to their newly remodeled buildings, nice of her. 
 

 We got settled in and while we weren't wowed with the room, it initially seemed good enough for a night's sleep before the next day's fair. The visit goes down-hill from there.  The upgraded room was small, had cracked tile on the outdated bathroom counter, had mold stains the shower and the bathroom floor grout was filthy.  This is the first hotel where I took the bedding apart to look for bed bugs. None found, thankfully, but that's the quality level of this place.
 

 The neighboring room blared their TV starting at 9:30pm.  I called the front office to ask them to ask the other guests to lower their volume level. Nothing happened.  No follow up, no phone ringing in the other room. The walls are thin enough to hear a phone ringing.
 

 We decided to tough it out and I hoped that getting to sleep quickly would solve much of the frustration. No such luck. Apparently, the folks next door need that level of TV sound to sleep through the night because the TV stayed on all night.
 

 I checked out in the morning and the young woman working the desk was exceedingly unhelpful.  She explained the room we were in was the upgraded room, most recently decorated building on the property.  I told her that if the room we stayed in was the most updated room they had, I'd like to see the crap room that I was supposed to stay in because I had paid a pretty penny for a room that shouldn't have been sold for more than $50.00.  She said those rooms were the most recently updated...about 10 years ago.  Wow, thanks. I noted they need to work on how they present these 'upgrades', because nothing about that room felt current.

 We started our meal with drinks that included a light refreshing Framboise spritzer made with grey goose vodka, chambord, lime , mint, and club soda and a Pome fume with gin and apple juice. Next came deliciously fresh crisp French bread with homemade creamy butter. Our entrees were mushroom and bacon stuffed chicken and le bec fin crab cakes.

I guess that's a really good thing, because the food was better than I remember Applebee's food being years ago, which is the last time I've been to an Applebee's.
 

 As an appetizer, we had the spinach and artichoke dip. As a main course, I tried the ""Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp"" for myself and also got to take a bite of someone else's ""Smokey Mozarella-Stuffed Ravioli with Grilled Chicken"". For dessert, we shared the ""Triple Chocolate Meltdown"".
 

 I liked everything I tried today, except for the mozarella-stuffed ravioli, and only because the sauce was terrible to me. It tasted alcoholic, sweet, and tangy - just everything that a sauce for ravioli was NOT supposed to be. But rest assured, I would recommend any of the other dishes from today. With the small number of people dining at 12 noon, I would think that extra attention to detail played a role in how good the food came out.
 

 The spinach and artichoke dip was deliciously hot and gooey and extra cheesey. Excellent with the chips. Nothing to complain about. The dish was a winner! And the bourbon street chicken and shrimp went excellently with the mushrooms and onions alongside it as well as the mashed potatoes. But the best part? The buttery garlic and parmesan sauce deserves an A+ because it just tied everything together.
 

 And, like is often the case, dessert was so yummy. The triple chocolate meltdown was essentially a lava cake with some vanilla ice cream. Can't go wrong when pairing chocolate and vanilla, or hot cake and cold ice cream for dessert! That gooey chocolate inside just ran onto the plate when you cut open the tender, soft, chocolatey cake.

47467,7edDFDu29KzpET2XtHWtfg,"4.5 stars on its way to 5 BIG stars! Variety, recipes, prices, & service will see to it! This new rising star replaces the former Heritage American Bistro that had opened for a brief period (to excellent reviews). Unfortunately for the bistro & its charming owners, the timing of its conception coincided w/ the onset of Covid & Covid restrictions. American Heritage closed its doors for Tampa Taco Co. to be born. (This Mexican restaurant is open all days but Tuesdays & Thursdays.) 
 

 Do NOT be misled by the business name. This establishment is SO MUCH MORE than a standard taco eatery. Appetizers include Chips & Guac, Chips & Queso, Mashed Potato Tacos, Elotes, Nachos, Quesadillas, Sopes, & Flautas. Available daily entrees offered are *Tacos ($2.75), Burritos ($8.50), Tortas ($8), Chimichangas ($9.50), & Tostadas ($3.50). The WEEKEND BRUNCH entrees are as follows: Chilaquiles, Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast Burito & Breakfast Tacos, Pancakes (varies depending upon the day), Biscuit & Gravy, & a Breakfast Bowl. (*Available taco varieties: fish, shrimp, veggie, pork, beef, & chicken)
 

 The married owners/chefs, Aliana & Cesar (see pic), are worthy partners. Hailing from the Dominican Republic & Puerto Rico/Mexico, they met in culinary school @ Johnson & Whales in Miami. A protégé, Aliana's father owns Zacatacos (5 Mexican eateries) in Chicago, & has assisted in the transformation of Heritage American Bistro to Tampa Taco Co. Even Aliana's grandmother has had a hand in the makeover; you can thank her for the rice & sauces.
 

 This clean restaurant offers many outside seats on the covered patio-- see pic. It's a perfect location for social distancing or for a dinner out w/ a favorite canine. 
 

 The large chalk menu is readily visible on the back wall. It lists the daily offerings as well as the Saturday & Sunday brunch entrees. Prices are low for the quality & quality of food you'll receive. 
 

 This talented couple is the epitome of the American dream, & one (like many) who are trying hard to survive the perils of 2020. I ordered three entrees to sample (& feed to my refrigerator shelves:). 
 

 The Tres Leches Pancakes (recommended by wonderfully friendly Chris) was my favorite entree of the day. For $7.00, I was treated to a large stack of deliciously flavorful & fluffy buttermilk pancakes topped w/ a generous heaping of whipped topping. The $8 Breakfast Burito was quite good; for me, it would have been even better if a sauce had accompanied it. And the creative & a little spicy Chilaquiles @ $9 was the most interesting dish; I loved the thick cheese that topped it & I enjoyed the crunch of the tortillas that served as its base. I like different, & it was something I've never found at another Mexican restaurant. 
 

 I will definitely return to try a basic taco, although I'm unsure if this talented culinary duo can produce just ""basic."" They simply have too much talent, potential, & ambition. Please don't take my word for it-- drive over to check out this wonderful addition to Lutz/Land 'O Lakes & the surrounding areas.

I didn't know bacon was on it but it was a good choice on the owners part to decide to make bacon part of their chicken philly. The bun/bread was sooo soft and buttered well.

 From a five to a two star.
 Here's why, I ordered the house chow mein it comes with beef, chicken, and shrimp. After getting a few very greasy and oily bites in, the chicken tasted old that gave off a nasty and odd taste in my mouth. The chicken looks like it's been sitting outside that turn the chicken to an odd brown coloring and also was kind of hard to chew. Not cool to serve up old chicken where you can get people food poisoning and especially serving it to me who comes 3 times a week for lunch. Sad to say I won't be coming back as often, maybe once every other month. Could of left it at one star but I'm nice enough to leave two star. Hope the owner see this and do something about it. FYI they also have a Mexican chef working in the kitchen, most likely my chow mein was made by him.

 The first time I went in was a few days before Christmas to get her a gift card as a present (I'm a genius). It was about 30 minutes before closing and the place was empty. Looking around it appeared to be similar to Blaze Pizza where there were a few restaurant originals on the menu or you could create your own with your choice of toppings, which were laid out before you (think Subway restaurant). I wasn't able to read much of the menu when a super nice dude popped up from behind the counter and greeted me. He familiarized me with their menu and how it works. I asked for a $50 gift card. He said if I bought two $25 cards, he would throw in two free pizzas. Sold. 
 

 Came back to eat a few weeks later. We both did modified versions of their Margharita. One was done with regular crust and the other on cauliflower crust. A gluten FRIENDLY crust is available, too. Staff here was (again) super friendly, enthusiastic, and went out of their way to make sure our experience was the best. The pizza was delicious. Another staff member who was equally as friendly and enthusiastic as the others came out and recommended we try some pesto to dip our crusts in. We agreed and she brought out two cups of it (for FREE). It was awesome.

 Got there at 5:30 and the place was jam packed. No problem. We happy hour vets figured we would find some seats at the bar in no time but that was not to be the case.
 

 First, the hostess said there was a wait for the booths and high top tables in the bar area as well. The bar itself sat maybe 15 people tops. Your only option was to stand behind those already seated at the bar. And do what? Breathe down the backs of their necks and irritate them into leaving? These folks were posted up for the long run so they were the lucky few who could actually enjoy the Happy Hour specials. 
 

 Since we had already loss time figuring out what to do and lost out on Happy Hour, we opted for a first available table anywhere. The margarita special was still good all evening. 
 

 The drinks at first seemed more parts sweet and sour than tequila which I had expected but by nights end I had a pretty good buzz. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I heard the empanadas and the quesadilla were good and my Calypso pasta was full of shrimp and very filling.

476018,4janPPhVbda7oM4y-PkwIQ,"Pretty surprised that at the time of my posting, The Foodery Chestnut Hill carries a 4 star rating. I'm giving it 3 (2.5) stars for two reasons 1) I have already been to this establishment once to get takeout beer, so the ""meh"" interior and menu didn't carry the same element of surprise 2) I was there when it was Towey's so it REALLY didn't surprise me. If, knowing nothing about this place, I had looked at The Foodery's website (which, conspicuously, doesn't list its CH location), and then showed up here, I'd be disappointed.
 

 Beers: I like beer I would say more than the average regular person, less than the average yuppie who has over $5 to spend/and or endless time to pontificate per bottle, and FAR less than homebrewbros (finger-down-throat-gag-emoji). When we got bar service, I easily found two beers that were tasty, priced right on draught, a suitable ABV and served to me by a friendly and attentive man. The bottle selection? I only visited once, but based on the number of coolers alone, it's mathematically impossible that they really have much to offer at this location. Again, I found stuff that I liked, some stuff to try, but if you were coming here for a wall of (new! Far-out! Hard to find!) beer, I doubt it's gonna hit the spot. 
 

 Food: WTF. Why is this place called The *Foodery*? I had already seen their food menu MONTHS ago, and never felt compelled to come back to try anything, cuz it's lame. I specifically came here on a night when I wasn't starving or especially looking forward to ""going out to dinner!"" (pro life tip: managing expectations) so that I wasn't angry when... my chicken tacos just kind of left me scratching my head. On the plus side, they came 2 to an order for $5.50 and had a nice amount of chicken and dive-bar-in-the-winter style tomato and lettuce. They just had - literally - no seasoning on them. It was chipped(?) chicken of the chicken-cheesesteak variety, which I have never had in a taco before and quite liked because chunks of breast really skeeve me. But, seriously... not even S&P let alone, garlic, onion... Idk, a frickin dash or two of anything called ""taco seasoning"" even? That's just... weird! 
 

 Boothang ordered a black and blue burger. It was fine, no more no less. 
 

 TL: DR; So, I guess I'd come here again if I had no real designs or aspirations for my night other than to get out of the house for a beer ...(which was truthfully the only reason I came to begin with!)

I was always taught that, if you have nothing right to say, don't say anything at all. The fact is, while there is room for improvement, I do have nice things to day. A lot of nice things... I also know that sharing your experience gives management an opportunity to become aware of potential issues and work to remedy them. I also know that a harsh and unfair review can have a devastating effect on a business and bring down employees. In that vein, I choose my words carefully and positively.
 

 First off, I am a HUGE fan of Chef Ray. Many a paychecks have gone to Rue 127 (money well spent), so I was super excited to try Frey.
 

 We went at lunch and they were packed! (Good on them!). And just the smell made me more hungry. We opted to sit outside (great choice) and ordered the pork belly poppers. Amazing, fatty pork belly rolled in a jalapeno jelly. My lunch partner moaned with delight at her first bite. My first bite....was ice cold. My next bite was warmish. It seems like maybe an old and new batch were likely combined as her first bite was piping hot. You certainly dont want cold pork belly but I can tell you that the flavors were so good. I imagine it is super awesome...when it's hot. 
 

 We split the three meat platter. Pork ribs, smoked chicken and brisket. The meat flavors were spot on! We also ordered brussel sprouts, charred and delicious, and definitely make a top 10 of bests in the city (that I have had anyway). And we had the spicy grilled cabbage. It was tasy but seemed to be tossed in some sort of mayo or dijon based sauce, which I didnt expect and let my friend finish that off. However, we did get seconds on the sprouts. 
 

 I ordered black coffee to end my meal and were told they were out of coffee. Forgiveable, and certainly didnt ruin the experience. Now I did not order dessert but the person next to us did. It seems the milkshakes are a big deal here so I couldnt oass up the opportunity to grab a pic of the Cookie Monster next to us (thanks to the Barman's Fund dude who allowed as much). 
 

 In short: food tastes excellent. More attention needed on expo so that delicious apps like the pork belly poppers are served at the correct temperature, service was (very) slow but enthusiastic and friendly when she was there. Refills (my pet peeve) were slowish but whenever our server appeared at the table, she always came with a tea and water pitcher. I truly believe that they got slammed but that she was always aware of what was needed and where.

 The king cake arrived in perfect condition. Although my cake decorating skills leave a LOT to be desired, the colorful sugar covers my sad skills.

528206,bNwY8hDGZAREpZvTFeN4zA,"Like other reviews, we too had a bad experience. What's odd was that it actually felt a bit hostile. For Santa Barbara that is very unusual. The issue started with the hostess who was openly hostile then it spread to the wait staff who appeared to be loyal to her colleague. The food was not as good as I remembered but that might have been due to how uncomfortable the staff made us feel. I do know that I could not eat the brussel sprouts, they were terrible. The fried chicken sandwich was tasty and the pretzel was ok. Our food, appetizers and entree, came at the same time so it was not a leisurely dinner. Half way in the hostess turned on the heaters (for no reason we could think of other than to annoy us) so that was pretty unpleasant. - It was one of those rare Santa Barbara nights when it stays around 70 and the air is perfect. - When the waitress came to clear our dishes, the only time we saw her, we told her the brussel spourts were bad and she replied ""well you should have said something""  - the openly hostile vibe was not something we wanted to engage in on a beautiful Friday night in SB so we smiled and said nothing.

The building, the counter, the sign, the tables: everything here looks like it's about to fall apart. Just close your eyes and inhale the heavenly aroma of everything that can be fried being fried. Better, yes?
 

 Lucky Wishbone is a real Tucson staple, and while I personally think their steakfingers are tough and flavorless, others seem to love them. At any rate, here you have a place that fries stuff, and they fry it correctly. If you would like to stuff your face with deep fried and mostly breaded, mostly meat items, this is absolutely the place to do it. Lots of food for a reasonable price (the cost of the defibrillator you will need after your inevitable heart attack not included). 
 

 Fries are always good here. I also like the shrimp and the wings. On a recent visit, I just got some plain wings and they were exactly what I wanted, although the idea that anyone would order plain wings seemed revolutionary/threatening to both the counter girl and the fry cook, and it was a good 5 minutes of me convincing them that this was, in fact, what I was ordering. Not breaded. Not doused in sauce. Not with sauce on the side. Just...wings. Eventually they figured out what I wanted, although they still got the order wrong: I asked for 8 and they gave me 12. No complaints. Just...you know...check your order.

102835,n_foOA8Rr9bL-Uku_MMa6w,"Been a little while since last I dropped by Brewer's Cabinet. But like all breweries in this city, I can't stay away forever. The BC is one of those places where there is great beer on tap and great food to go along with it. Been open for a few years now, and you can't miss the place. It's the building always crowded with customers and bustling with activity, located at the somewhat awkward corner of California and Arlington in that weird quasi-district where Downtown and Midtown sort of start to blur into each other.
 

 On this occasion it was a pleasant evening, perhaps one of the last few we'll have this autumn, so I opted to sit around back in the relatively newly remodeled beer garden. This small but very pretty oasis is lined with flowers and vines, and is one of the best outdoor seating spots I've been to in town. The perfect spot to enjoy some dinner and drinks, especially when the weather is pleasant.
 

 The chow here is really dang good. Beer and food fans alike should have Brewer's Cabinet on their radar. Good burgers, awesome appetizers based mostly around pub favorites, and a few in-house specialty dishes thrown in for good measure. For my money, though, you must, MUST go with their Tater Tots. Don't think about it, just go get them! Trust me on this. One bite means instant addition to these delightful sauce-smothered spud-nuggets. Beyond those, the lamb burger is really tasty, and some of their desserts are very enjoyable.
 

 Now, the beers here are quite excellent indeed. Their flagship Tahoe Beers can be found on-tap and in cans all over our region. A good glass of their Tahoe amber is just the thing after a long day. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Dirty Wookie. This is probably my favorite local brown beer. Dark, dense, with hints of vanilla, it is utterly delicious. Whenever I head to the luxury theaters, this is my go-to drink of choice to get me through the film. Admittedly, however, I forwent the flagships this evening and focused on their newest creation for which I was much excited; the Electrum IPA, a collaboration with Sierra Nevada Brewing Company. I have to say, this IPA was superb. Smooth, clean, not too overly hoppy. I seriously hope they keep this one around as a new permanent placement on the beer list. The name fits it perfectly, given that this is a great combination of efforts from the Silver and Golden States.
 

 As for downsides, it is hard to list any real significant one. Probably the two biggest gripes I have both stem from the same issue; the lack of space. It is very clear they have sort of outgrown their location, with the joint constantly looking like it's at capacity. The addition of outdoor seating and the expanded beer garden certainly helps, but the constant crowds and tight quarters are just unavoidable signs of how popular they are. Likewise, parking can be kind of a pain, as the few spaces for the building are quickly taken, and the side streets can be difficult to locate a curbside spot in. But these have never been so frustrating as to deter me from coming. So I'd suggest just shrug it off and enjoy the rest of your evening.
 

 Prices are decent, portions for food are good, and service is always very friendly. I raise my glass to the BC and their staff, and hope they continue all the fantastic work.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
430160,ZO5ROkUonU6HlnUC8H5EEg,"I've been to the Xtreme Tacos' food truck in Seminole Heights several times and loved it, so I was very excited when they opened their full restaurant in SoHo! I wasn't disappointed! 
 

 One of the best things about Xtreme Tacos is it's a family-owned, local business. I learned this on my visit. You can tell by the friendly conversation, excellent customer service, and fresh food. There are other taco/bowl places in the area but they don't have the legit local, family-owned bonafides of Xtreme Tacos. 
 

 We decided to get our food to go on this first trip to the restaurant since we were exhausted from a long work day. Although the atmosphere was relaxed and inviting. I learned from one of the family members working that evening that all the art/murals on their walls are painted by a local artist. He explained how they like to support other local artists and businesses as well. The Frida Kahlo mural is amazing! The tables were decorated with mini squash and pumpkins for the fall season and everything was sparkling clean. I also loved the taco piñatas! 
 

 The menu is extensive and I've included photos from the restaurant board. There are numerous options! In the past I have gotten their burrito at the food truck and it has always been delicious and HUGE! That's just the regular size burrito. I've seen the Stoner burrito and it is named quite appropriately. It's GIGANTIC and the perfect food if you have a craving for some reason... ahem. 
 

 They have quite a few vegetarian/vegan options and they have a KETO bowl! Yeah! I try to eat Keto friendly and it's so wonderful to find a menu item at a restaurant! I got the Keto bowl with shredded beef ($8.99 + $1 up charge for the shredded beef) and my boyfriend got the Keto bowl with Carnitas ($8.99). Only a couple of protein options have the small up charge. Check out the photos of our keto bowls. They were both delicious! They give you large servings of the homemade pico de gallo and guacamole in the Keto bowl and they are out of this world delicious! I plan to try the Keto bowl with the grilled chicken on my next visit. 
 

 They also make all of their salsas fresh each day. I tasted the avocado salsa which is milder. It's yummy and probably my favorite because I love anything avocado, but the medium salsa is delicious with a good amount of heat and so much fresh cilantro. The hot salsa (red one) is extremely hot! It's a bit too hot for me since I prefer to feel my lips and tongue but if you like hot, you'll like this salsa! 
 

 The one thing I asked the owner is about adding the option of getting a lettuce shell/wrap for the tacos. He said that they haven't added that option yet but if enough customers were interested, they would be open to adding it. He explained since this location has only been opened about 6 weeks, they are still open to options on the menu. Fingers crossed they decide to add it! 
 

 While I didn't partake, I did notice they had a selection of beers and other drinks in a cooler behind the counter. 
 

 Parking is in the back of the building. They have signs to point you in the right direction. If for some reason it gets filled up, it seems there is some street parking on the side streets. There is no parking in front of the building nor any other businesses I saw in that area. 
 

 They have a small, side patio for you to eat outside at bar style seating. This is a good option if you have a furry friend with you.

The falafel balls were absolutely amazing - light, flavorful and nothing like I have tried at any other falafel shop. Great job there - do not change a thing! The reason this is a 3 star and not 5 is because the sandwich itself is a little dry at first. That is because they mix the sauce with a few falafels along with the veggies and dump it in the pita. Then they add two more falafels on top (no sauce whatsover) So by the time you eat your sandwich all the sauce has traveled at the bottom of the pita. So for half the sandwich everything is very dry then goes into extra sauce - there is no inbetween.

 Both the fried chicken wings and the fried popcorn chicken are delicious, I can't decide which is better. The wings are great because they are just as crispy as the popcorn chicken. My favorite sauce is the honey soy spicy- it's unique, different from your typical soy sauce but is still simple. You can make it as spicy or mild as you want as well. Highly recommend this place.

The order came with four soft shell crab that were well seasoned with what appeared To have a Cajun influence. The batter was crisp and not oily. The remoulade dipping sauce was the perfect accompaniment. The sides we chose were collard greens and Cajun Cole slaw. The greens were very flavorful but not too salty. The slaw was creamy. The add-ons were fried oysters and shrimp. These two made for the perfect finish to a create-your-own seafood platter. The hush puppies were crunchy on the outside but not to doughy on the inside. Topping it off we had the pineapple bread pudding. The flavor was good but too much sauce. I'll request the sauce on the side next time.

 I'll definitely say that Terrain Garden Cafe has it spot on with their theme. They have different seating options, whether you want a indoor or outdoor seating, but all with an intimate environment. Everything they place in front of you is handcrafted to look pleasant and fresh.
 

 The food was ok to say the least. For appetizers, we ordered the Farmhouse Board. No complaints! Their lavender butter was delicious! So creamy with the perfect hints of lavender. It really complemented the bread with the right touches of flavor. 
 

 However for entrees, I ordered the steak with fries. The steak was a little chewy across all my friends' who ordered varying from medium rare to well. The fries were a little too salty for our taste. My friend said her burger was subpar as well. Although plentiful and aesthetic, I don't think the quality was worth the $20+ price point.

85043,OEgJKpOYrkD84Qn0ImHbUQ,"Butcher and Singer was next up on my Stephen Starr list and steakhouse in Philadelphia. A late Valentine's Day celebration was the perfect time to check it out. 
 

 When we arrived for our 5:30 reservation, we were promptly sat and asked if we would like our jackets hung - politely declined. The server was very attentive and gave his recommendations right off the bat. Tip from the server: the kitchen cooks their steaks a bit on the lower side, so a medium is generally a medium-rare anywhere else. Very happy about the service! 
 

 We put in our order - crab dip for an appetizer and the 28-Day Dry Aged Porterhouse for two with the stuffed hash browns and macaroni & cheese for the main dish. While we waited, we were given warm biscuits and butter. The biscuits were delicious - flaky and moist, albeit a little on the saltier side - with the creamy butter enhancing them. They were quickly finished and the server said he'd get us more...never trust anyone who says no to more!
 

 While we waited for more biscuits, the crab dip came out. Definitely a highlight of the meal for me. If you like heaps of crab and gooey, baked cheese, you're in for a treat. My only qualm was the shortage of crispy bread for dipping. Do not fret, however, because those extra biscuits came in for the save. Recommend as an appetizer!
 

 The main course was where I make my assessment of Butcher and Singer - it's a steakhouse! When the steak arrived, we were asked to ensure it was to our requested temperature, which was a perfect medium-rare (aka a MEDIUM in their books). The Porterhouse cut consists of two cuts on the bone: the tenderloin and the top loin (aka New York Strip). The New York Strip side was dominated by a smokey-charred taste - big let down. The tenderloin portion was less charred, but still lacked a good seasoning to compliment the perfect, moist meat. We ordered au poivre which definitely came in handy to mask the charred and allow the meat to shine a bit. Still disappointing. 
 

 Sides were okay but plentiful. The stuffed hash browns definitely needed help from the au poivre to enhance the flavor otherwise lacked flavor. I did really like the mac & cheese, however. It was creamy and noodles were cooked perfectly - really good for leftovers consistency. If you don't like breadcrumbs on your mac & cheese: beware. 
 

 

 For dessert, we ordered the Baked Alaska and the Key Lime Pie. Again, our server made a clutch recommendation: if you don't finish, take home the key lime and freeze - it's better! It was my first time having Baked Alaska so I don't have a baseline, but a let down in my books - would not order again. The key lime pie - better at-home, frozen - was dense and yummy, especially if you like a strong lime flavor like me.

 But in the Donair game...it's flavor and value!

 Just a sad little thing. Roughly rhe size of a pop can. Good grief ‍
 Meat...dry. Almost rubbery. Little flavor.
 Sweet sauce...thick...but bland.
 I completely removed my meal from all it's wrappers, and only needed one napkin to wipe my face. There was no moisture in this thing. There was no mess. No drips. Nothing. Not what a donair should be!
 Pita was ok...but tiny.

I got the salmon salad and the lemon pepper wings n fries combo. The salmon was smoked/baked to perfection, with a great seasoning base, with the skin side left on and crisp, all the flavorful fats have fully cooked so the flesh slides off easily if that skin is not your thing. Salad is as pictured: cherry tomatoes, a single boiled egg split in two, shredded mild cheddar, slices baby cucumbers and small croutons. Shredded romaine. The lemon pepper wings were delicious, smoked to a crispy perfection, and the seasoning blend has a sweet note that pairs well with what tasted like applewood smoke so you're having the smoked and seasoned skin crunching into a juicy lemon peppery chicken wing, it was just right. The wings are so good I can't remember how many pieces there were, maybe 6-8? The fries are McDonald shaped, seasoned with Cajun seasoning/Tony's. All in all a good experience. If you decide to pick up, you just park on the street, residential neighborhood, there's a small sign on the mailbox which I didn't see at first, the driveway may or may not have a car parked but the waist high iron gate has a white doorbell button that I didn't need because the family has a set up mother in law suite looks like attached to a longer garage/smokehouse, anyway they can see you clearly if you're standing, everyone was wearing protective gear and their face mask (which just recently was no longer mandated so I wouldn't trip, just wear your own) and asked who you were picking up for.

Some of that improvement would come with time as the insane crowding and lines cut down as the hype normalizes. Right now everyone and their mom is heading here. The hype normalizesshould also help servers being more attentive, the cooks being able to focus on quality of food better, and not having to wait forever for a drink or them even running out of common beers.
 

 My honest opinion, wait to go. Get better enjoyment out of your time instead of trying to be apart of the overcrowding and overwhelmed staff. 
 

 As far as the actual establishment? A 5 for sure. Hell I would go here just for drinks and watching football. The tv setup above and around the bar is simply spectacular. Rivals almost any sports bar for best set up. As you would expect with a new build you also get the fresh, clean, and modern atmosphere and ambience. A very large eating area (bigger then most DBs), a room dedicated to billiards, huge wrap around bar, and of course the game room. All top notch. 
 

 Weird thing here is though unlike most DBs they seem to be featuring their bar and eating area more then the games. Most DBs I've been to the eating and bar area is off in the cut, and the gaming area is front and center. This one is opposite. Was hoping they cut down on crowding in game room, but that didn't happen lol. 
 

 I do feel like I got decent value from the games. Played for hours, paid 30$ for game card, and still had plenty of digital play points left to rollover till next time. The card readers did seem a little jacked though. Most of them took a few swipes to get it to register, but either way it's better then one pocket full of coins and one pocket full of tickets.

I don't like to leave bad reviews but this was the worst food I have ordered and am so disappointed that we paid $40 for a meal we couldn't even eat.
 

 Our experience started off bad right off the bat. I don't really like meat or tofu in my curry. They have a vegetable curry for 9.95. My boyfriend ordered and asked if they could replace the tofu with some more vegetables and they said yes. After we paid we realized that they charged us $13.95 for my dish because of that??? The MEAT curry that comes with a choice of PROTEIN is 12.95. How is my ""extra vegetable"" curry more expensive that that? Especially when considering I didn't get tofu? That was whack. 
 

 My boyfriend got the basil chicken and literally could not eat it because it was so salty. I'm not kidding you this dish was literally inedible. If you think top ramen has a lot of sodium, it's no where near the amount as the basil chicken. 
 

 Rice does NOT come included with the meal so we ordered it on the side. When our meals came out, the rice was already in the curry. We get Thai a lot and never have I gotten my curry with rice in it. I like to add how much I want to, and I like to be able to take it home for leftovers (not that we wanted to take this home anyway). 
 

 My ""extra vegetable"" curry came with a basic amount of vegetables so I don't know what I paid an extra $4 but on top of that, the vegetables are SO WEIRD. My curry came with full mushrooms, they weren't even sliced. And full on cherry tomatoes. Who puts a cherry tomato into a curry. It was a cold tomato in hot curry. What?

 Specialty stores run abound in Fishtown, and Liberty Kitchen is no different. Despite the tiny space, Liberty highlights local and imported products alike in its miniature, Di Bruno-esque grocery. Gourmet tinned fish and high-end hot sauce line the shelves, while fresh baked goods and meats available by-the-pound are stocked up at the deli counter. Looking for something prepared? Opt for some deli-style takeout options.
 

 But don't expect service with any sense of urgency, or, in our case, even a smile -- even a short line could leave you waiting upward of 10 minutes. And for takeout, definitely call ahead or expect to wait an additional 20 minutes after you order.
 

 On a recent bike ride through Fishtown, my partner and I decided to swing by Liberty for a bite to eat. We settled on the Della Casa and Heritage Ham hoagies, and after our queue, headed over to a local garden to soak up the spring sunshine. The seeded rolls were moderately well-filled with a carefully curated selection of locally sourced charcuterie and novel accompaniments, and the high quality was evident in the ingredients. The Della Casa showcased a pleasant spectrum of flavors, from the richness of the meats to the tang of the red pepper spread. Meanwhile, the Heritage Ham enlisted pickled onions as the ideal complement to its otherwise standard (but good-quality) list of ingredients.
 

 The sandwiches were solid -- but not nearly tasty or large enough to justify the $12-13 price range (before tax). While I can envision Liberty as a reliable spot for those already in the neighborhood, I wouldn't say that it's worth a trip out of your way if you already have your own go-to specialty grocer nearby.",0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

 The blistered Shishito peppers were a real treat. Great flavor with a very nice salt sprinkling (Himalayan Pink?). I actually went to Lowes and found these plants and bought 3 of them so I can make these myself. Careful, while most of the peppers are not hot some are, a kind of pepper roulette.
 

 My wife and I decided to try to different dishes to get a better taste profile. We had the duck and the seafood. Both dishes were very good and abundant. The duck broth was soothing and enveloping. The seafood broth was very familiar, it tasted very similar to an ""arroz con camarones"" dish that I make. My stock is usually made with mostly crab, lobster and shrimp shells and this was much like it. The seafood was perfectly cooked which is a pet peeve of mine. Cudo's !!

I arrived at about 10 am and was able to find parking in the back. It's a decent sized lot and is free the first 2 hours. Then it's $2 for each additional 1/2 hour. The annoying thing is they put a 3 hour limit on your parking. If I'm going to a coffee shop to work and plan on buying drinks and food, I should be able to stay for longer than 3 hours. Parking in front seems to be free though if you're lucky enough to grab a spot. Not sure if there is a time limit though. 2 hours seems to be the norm for this area.
 

 I came in through the back entrance right by the counter. There were a few booths to the left which is a nice option if you don't mind being by the busy counter. My friend was already there and had a table saved so I began my search. I was so surprised to see how big this place is! There are 3 different rooms full of tables. But beware, this place gets busy and has no problem filling up. 
 

 After putting my stuff down I headed back up to the front to order a little somethin somethin. It was a cold rainy day so I ordered a tea. They had a good selection of black, green, and herbal teas. I was given a hot mug of water and was told to pick out my own tea. I believe it was about $2 for the tea which is a very fair price. When I was hungry, I also ordered the Local Burger. I have heard great things about this burger so I had to give it a try. It was $13 (burger+fries) which I thought was a bit steep for a coffee shop burger, especially after tax and tip. However, it turned out to be one of the best burgers I've had in Nashville. It's a beef/lamb mix so it has a classic burger taste with a little something special. The fries were also deliciously seasoned and crispy. If burgers aren't your thing, they have a pretty big menu full of yummy sandwiches, breakfast foods, and salads. Check out the chalk board for their daily specials. I also saw some muffins and desserts for sale. 
 

 Fido gives you a homey coffee shop feel with some really great food. The chairs are just wood chairs so you won't be getting too comfortable, but it works.

 The coffee is better than Starbucks. This isn't even a close contest. The decaf doesn't taste of chemicals and the regular comes with or without the chicory we love here in New Orleans. There are only three others with better coffee. French Truck, Mojo and District. I think this coffee is much better than PJs too. It's less money than any of the places I just listed especially if you use your punch card.
 

 The pastries are by and large from Maple Street and are very good. Solid. The bagels are very good for New Orleans. The caveat being that I'm from Chicago and have standards. I've not tried the sandwiches or salads but if you want a coffee and pastry, this is my morning choice in this neighborhood.
 

 The staff aren't rude, they just aren't friendly. There's a difference. They're not going to ask you how your day is going. On the whole they're not all that extroverted. When you get to know them, they warm up but they are never rude. I go almost every day and have NEVER seen this happen. It's Probably you. Smile and say hello before you offer your command. I doubt highly the service is any friendlier at the local chain.  
 

 Trashing this place based on it's ambiance feels like you don't really understand New Orleans at all. It's comfortable, there's reading material and there's a nice outdoor space in case you really can't stand the Garden District vibe. This is where the locals in the neighborhood hang out and if you don't like it, then you're making a commentary on us.
 

 Having to use the bathroom isn't their problem. There are countless places in the French Quarter that require you buy something. It's hard to believe you would dock this place for that. In Europe you have to pay to use the toilet. Buy a bottled water and support local business.  
 

 This brings me to my last plea. Supporting local business. When there are no more local businesses New Orleans will just be Disneyland. Local businesses like this make our home what it is.

I was shocked that I haven't written a review before....since I go every time I am in Clearwater. So...this time I made a point to check in for sure!
 

 Nice cozy place with plenty of tables in dining area and a few at the bar area. Nicely decorated and in European fashion, there is a store. 
 The food is so amazing, you will have a hard time picking just one thing....so do like us...order several!
 on this trip we had the Stuffed Cabbage Roll (Golabek), caesar salad, dill pickle soup, Ukrainian Borsh soup, and the mixed pierogi plate. 
 Hello deliciousness!!! The cabbage roll was tender, filled with beef and rice topped with a tomato sauce. The dill pickle soup (creamy pickle soup with potatoes, carrots & sour cream) was OUT of this world! Ukrainian Borsh soup (cabbage, beets, potatoes, onions, beans, and dill) had me dancing in my seat with such flavor. The pierogi platter was 6 of each, spinach and beef/kraut/bacon/onion....oh so good!
 I have had the Schnitzel, the Polish Sausage, meat platter, and I have had the potato pancakes....all worth writing home about.
 I will be back...again and again....
 Oh and I washed my food down with....zywiec...a great Polish beer!
 Oh and lastly....go on your birthday for a free pierogi meal...just be sure to show your id!",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

 Brochetas - the chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy, but the steak was a bit chewy
 Huevona - the mozzarella was more than I could wanted, still tasty.

 Sangrias - are made fresh, def worth the try! (Pitchers available for larger groups)

Arrived around 3:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was a decent size crowd. My two friends had already been seated at a table. Once seated, my friends advised me that in order to order a drink, I would have to scan the QR code that was on the table. The QR code then prompted for the downloading of an application which then required a rescanning of the QR code and then I could proceed to order a drink. I'm already about 6 minutes into the process and finally my drink order had been received, at least according to the application. It was least another 12 minutes before actually receiving my drink. It was literally just a Titos Vodka and Soda with a splash of cranberry.
 

 On at least 3 occasions, a server arrived at our table with a food order that wasn't ours. I was ready for a 2nd drink, so I proceeded to open up the app and order another drink. After about 15 minutes, I proceeded to flag down a server and advise that I was still waiting for my drink. Another several minutes passed and I proceeded to flag down yet another server (the first one was nowhere to be found) and advise that they can just cancel my drink altogether. It was time to ditch this place altogether. She advised that she would get it taken care of. Two minutes later, and the drink arrived. I again reminded the server that this was supposed to have been canceled and he advised that they would make sure it was taken off the bill. It was.
 

 Epic fail at service! It was a nice attempt to utilize technology to try and make things efficient but I have no idea why they can't staff a bartender at the bar to make cocktails. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that this place is still in business with all the negative press that was received about it when the pandemic first happened. There were a lot of angry workers back then, and today there was at least one angry customer.

My husband and I were in the Rittenhouse area last Thursday and we decided on Parc for an early meal. I was excited as I hadn't been there in quite some time. The weather was some of the first real spring weather we have been wanting so badly here in Philadelphia so the outside wait was a lot longer than indoors so we chose to sit inside. 
 

 We were seated in a section that only had one other table. So I will start by saying we were in a secluded area so I tried really hard to give the benefit of the doubt to our server who completely forgot about us. When we were seated it took a few for our waitress to acknowledge us. She came over basically said hello and then disappeared. When she finally surfaced my husband and I watched her cater to her other table in front of us. The floor manager walked by us, acknowledged us, knew we had been sitting with nothing for awhile, and still walked by not saying anything. It wasn't until we had to flag her down again to grab our waitress. The floor manager apologized and took our order herself. A bit later our waitress walked over and apologized by saying ""Sorry I really forgot about you guys!"" While laughing. I wasn't amused and that night I realized 'hanger' is a real thing. They brought over our food and onion soups shortly after. They also brought us more complimentary bread on top of the complimentary bread they originally give you when you sit down. I guess that was there way of saying sorry? I only found the onion soup just okay which I was surprised about. 
 

 For entrees my husband ordered the steak frites and I ordered the warm shrimp salad. I had a bite of my husbands steak and it was so ordinary. He wished he had ordered something else. NOW, my salad. I could go on forever how amazing it was. Every flavor worked, all ingredients went together, and the shrimp was out of this world. Definitely worth $20. Highly recommend it and it was the saving grace of my meal.

I'm pretty stubborn about demanding a visit to Bartaco every time I'm in Nashville, but now I can no longer confidently recommend this restaurant. 
 

 Stopped in for an early lunch on Saturday and beat the crowd (whew!) so we were immediately seated outside. Our server was quick to come over and asked if we had any questions as we looked over the drink menu. Given the patio seating and the sunshine, I was in the mood for something light and tropical. Our server recommended the seasonal caipirinha, which he described as ""sweet and fruity"". I'm not sure if he got the description wrong or the bartender made it wrong, but I took a sip and sip it out. Extremely bitter, nothing sweet about it. I had to send it back. 
 

 Next came our large guac, still my favorite thing on the menu. The chips, however, were far more salty than I remember. I agree with other reviews that said the chips appeared to have salt dumped on them. I had to dust them off as best as I could for fear of my blood pressure rising. Then came the tacos that I love so much...or at least used to. My FAVORITE is the pork belly taco, so naturally I ordered 2 without hesitation and 1 fish taco, which I have also had before and liked. The pork belly has always been extremely tender and slow roasted. Either that has changed or I got the bad luck of getting in both my tacos what I would call the burnt ends. I mean they were rock hard and crunchy, not at all the texture or taste I was expecting. The fish was also not as good as I remember and too heavy on the batter.

 My two visits in November of 2017 were not stellar. Both times sitting at the bar, the service was lacking. They either need to put a second bartender on duty to expedite service. Or, they need to sign the male bartender they have up on match.com. Better yet, get him a date. He was more interested in working the single ladies then serving up cocktails. 
 

 Another reason for the removal of a star was the preparation of one of my favorites here, the Mussels. The night in question, they did not have the same flavor I am use to and enjoy. It was off and left an after taste. I only ate four and left the remaining in the bucket. Luckily I had started the night with Fried Green Tomatoes which are always a winner. 
 

 My other go to's did not disappoint me in November and that is the Clams and while their Chips are a delicious side, I always upgrade to the fries. I can also, never go wrong with an order of Hush Puppies. They're always a tasty accompaniment to my Manhattan.

 I wish they had more meat choices, and more authentic Korean marinades for their meat, but I love getting the Choice 2 for the chuck blade and short ribs and the quality of the meat in general is decent for the price.

 - Muffaletta - this thing is giant, like the size of my head LOL. But it is also delicious. The bread was soft and the layers of meat just wonderfully prepared and tasty. 
 

 - Soup of the day Ham Hock with Mustard Greens - this is literally, I kid you not, the best soup I have ever tried. I took one sip and truly said ""don't talk to me for 10 min"" while I drank the rest of it. I was struggling a little from the night before and it was a bit chilly out and this was a bowl of tasty magic. The ham was smoky and so flavorful and the greens complimented the flavor so well. I wish I could have had the whole pot. The other food we got was not bad but this was truly the highlight. We still talk about this soup. SO GOOD. 
 

 - Brussels sprouts - a lot of meat in this meal so gotta order some veggies. Cooked to perfection without being soggy, seasoned very generously, a nice crunch and soft interior. 
 

 - baked Mac and cheese - Mac and cheesy goodness. No complaints.

We were looking for more of a quick, almost drive thru type place but not a drive thru if you know what I mean. I am not a fan of big chain places for restaurants or even drive thru. 
 

 I came across Better Byrd for a chicken sandwich, sounded perfect and they had unique options that I am sorry to say Chick fil a fans, you will never find there. 
 

 I ordered the Number One Sandwich, minus the pickles with the potato bun. The chicken was very juicy, the bun felt like it was steamed and it was a good size (I even had to take away some bread because I was getting too full). I also ordered a large fry for us to share. 
 

 Ben ordered the Mac & Bryd Sandwich with the potato bun. Their Mac and Cheese has a kick to it with jalapenos and bacon. This was also juicy and the mac and cheese was a big amount on top of the sandwich.
 

 So one major compliant about ordering this... it is pretty messy and we planned on eating it while in the parking lot and they did not give us even 1 napkin or a fork (it will be needed to get the mac that falls out of the sandwich) nor was there an option to request ketchup on the Grubhub ordering system through Yelp, so Ben had to go back up to request these items and they did not know where to find them so it took a while. For take out, all those options should be readily available right there and napkins should always be placed in a to-go bag. 
 

 I do also want to point out that not all options were available through the Grubhub ordering system vs their online menu from their website directly. Like you only have the option to order a large fry vs they do have small fries and honestly, when we got ours, for the price, I was shocked at the amount. 
 

 I can't wait to be able to go to this place when I can dine in and see the other items not available for take out like the donuts!

 The food is better than I remember. The bibimbap was better than I remember but my expectations were far lower this time around. The burger was also cooked properly and the meat is good quality.
 

 Now the bad, of which there were many: service was horrible. Not the worst I've ever had but we looked around for the waitress to order appetizers and it took awhile to track her down. Then we tried to order our entrees and I tried to flag her down about three times and finally gave up. She finally came over on her own in due time. 
 

 The dumplings are terrible. Don't order them. They are heavily fried and breaded, not just pan seared like many fried dumpling places. These are literally like chicken wings fried. On top of that, there's barely any meat in them. These are not real fried dumplings. The menu also doesn't state how they are made (steamed or fried) and the Asian community serves steamed as the standard which is how I assumed they would come if it wasn't specified.
 

 The burger, while cooked well, was LOADED was bacon. Like AT LEAST six strips. While I appreciate the quantity, 2 strips of bacon is plenty for me on a burger. Six is overdoing it. I could barely taste the beef as the bacon was too overwhelming. I ended up taking off some bacon in order to enjoy my burger. 
 

 We also ordered the calamari which was good but not great. So in conclusion: poor service, mediocre food. I gave it a second chance but I won't be back.

 We got a nice, long table for two. Although after all our orders came out, we realized then that even our table wasn't long enough. But the restaurant had the foresight to station a two-tiered cart next to the table for the purpose of holding some of the overflows.
 

 We got the YuanYang Base with two choices of broths. We went with the Spicy & Special House Beef Broth and the Spicy & Tomato Base (spice level for both bases: medium spicy). For our protein, fiber and carbs, we got shitake mushrooms, bean sprouts, meatball combo (beef, pork and fish balls), prime lamb, pork belly and their handmade noodles. In short, we went overboard. But as the saying goes, ""Go big or go home!"" And we didn't want to go home with empty stomachs.
 

 The pork and lamb were sliced paper-thin... the taste and quality were excellent although we wished the meat had been a tad thicker. The shitake mushrooms were of the smaller variety. The partner-in-dine found the meatballs a bit strange and he quickly surrendered all of the balls to me. He was thinking of meatballs with ground meat, but he quickly learned that Chinese meatballs are of the fish-cake type. As for the soup base, we both preferred the spicy tomato base for its spunk and kick. 
 

 We didn't avail of the self-serve sauce station (which comes with a minute fee). The soup bases were enough in our opinion. Basically, it boils down to individual taste and preference. 
 

 All in all, we came out of the restaurant satiated and in hotpot heaven. Just a side note, they had mistakenly charged us for the self-serve sauce at first but when told about it, they immediately revised the bill. The price for two big eaters was reasonable considering all the food we got.

They know how many people are booked for the night so they should have planned accordingly. Second, to substitute for the spread, we were given little tubs of a butter spread. Not even real butter, plus it had a very oily taste to it. Not what I would expect from an authentic Italian restaurant. Third, the acoustics are horrible. I could hardly even hear my husband.
 

 Now the highlights. Service was good and the food was incredibly delicious. We shared the mussels in red sauce as an appetizer and there had to be at least two dozen of them, if not more. The red sauce was very light and very good. I got the grilled Bronzino over angel hair with roasted cherry tomatoes in a light butter and white wine sauce. So so good.

We forsure eat a lot and this was more than enough for the 4 of us. We also had it with the AZN sauce and sweatin sauce. Both very good, but the sweatin s as ice did have a slight kick, which was good. All I gotta say is, everyone needs to try this place, especially if you love seafood and a huge fan of boiling crab.

 Each dish we had tickled my culinary imagination and opened new doors of spices and flavors. 
 

 

 The food: We ordered a dozen raw oysters, beef tartare, and succotash.
 

 Raw oysters with cucumber mignonette,fresh horseradish, and saltines. I never thought I would be putting cucumber anything on my raw oysters! OMG IT IS SO GOOD AND REFRESHING. Seriously, if you like [or love] raw oysters you HAVE to check out The Franklin and have these. You will not be disappointed.
 

 Beef Tartare. Our waiter recommended this dish and I am so glad he did. The tartare has pho garnishes mixed in and is served with a flaky, crispy puff. Even though the server told us it did indeed have a familiar pho taste, I wasn't sure what to expect. Sure enough it tasted like the sexy, delicious child of the world's best pho and beef tartare. Just a beautiful symphony/rave of flavors. 
 

  Spaetzle Truly I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this dish. I was delightfully impressed. The dish consists of simply succotash and Parmesan. It had just the right amount of cheese and warmth. 
 

 

 The environment I will just go ahead and say it. The Franklin is sexy. Dim lit. Warm, relaxing colors. They have beautiful art including a large piece by Alyssa Monk (people submerged in water=sexy) and a person in a full body cheetah print suit on a couch, gives it a touch of BDSM feel (again, sexy).

 It always makes me feel a bit odd to go to a restaurant in the lobby of a hotel, but this isn't that. So first off the space is amazing. I may be in the minority here but I love how roomy everything is. There is an amazing amount of space between tables and so servers aren't trying to squeeze by, and I don't feel like I have to listen to anyone else's conversation. Win. 
 Let's get to the food--it's Mediterranean inspired and done oh so well. I would go back for the baked cheese alone. Can this be my happy hour? A drink and baked cheese? I do wish it came with some bread as opposed to being 2$ extra. 
 The octopus was cooked perfectly and while I loved everything else on the dish (squash, sauce, mushrooms)--I just wanted more octopus! 
 The cauliflower was executed so well. 
 But... my favorite part of my meal was the lamb shank. I am normally not a person who chooses lamb on the menu.... but this I would do a billion times over. It's perfectly cooked and fall off the bone. It gives zahav's a run for its money!

 + Uni on scallops and lime: this was the best thing we ordered. Six pieces for $16.95 or so. I heard the Santa Barbara sea urchin was amazing, and it really was!! 
 + Half-dozen oysters: this was fresh and reasonably priced. The oysters were also big, which was a plus.
 - Crab Cakes: comes with onion rings and cole slaw. This came out cold, and the onion rings were soggy and disappointing. Would skip this next time.
 + Local Crab: two pounds of crabby goodness with a side of cole slaw. The crab was definitely fresh, and it was already pre-cracked as well.

 - Bloody Mary: it was not very good, even though it was $7.95. You get what you paid for, I guess?

 I've gone to many White Dog Cafe locations for several meals back in my college days. Once particularly with my mother.
 

 The following is a review for one of their staff members, that was hired on by the White Dog Cafe establishment, quite some time ago. It ruined my appetite for this restaurant, for quite some time.
 

 There was a host hired on by this restaurant establishment, by the name of Patrick.
 

 Patrick, the host of White Dog Cafe at this time, seats us to our table. This host's creepy friend at the time - by the name of Rajeev, comes in.
 

 He starts slandering my mother and I, within earshot.
 

 Looking at me repeatedly. Literally just staring me up and down, like a piece of meat.
 

 Then whispering to the host of the restaurant, Patrick: ""But man, she's crazy. And her mom, she's crazy.""
 

 I didn't really even know or care about the guy. Except for on a basic human level, of course. It ruined my meal, the experience, and the ambience for me.
 

 If you're that obsessed with talking about me, then maybe you're the crazy one?
 

 Or maybe you just needed a reason to look at me, because you know you wanted to? Deep down?
 

 If unprofessional staff like that is still present, I'd avoid. I was always impressed with the food, but this interaction scarred me from returning to this cafe chain for quite some time.
 

 Considering the gourmet, farm-to-table vibe: the host and even his company should always be professional.
 

 I think just as a basic rule of thumb: Customers do not want to be slandered or gossiped about while they are dining. Particularly by the host of restaurant, or his friends.
 

 Even more than that, I did not want to hear this lowlife, Rajeev, slander my mother. He didn't even know her. Where is the respect for your elders, on a human level?

I was eating some of his too because normally white meat isn't as tender as dark, but this was very juicy and tender. The chicken had a nice heat to it and crunch.

The food is average to good in terms of flavour in comparison to other restaurants but I found it a bit too overpriced. Personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
 

 I went here with a friend during a Monday evening and wow! It was incredibly empty and deserted; the restaurant was very spacious but we were the only ones who were there. I did not necessarily choose to go here, in the contrary, my friend had a Groupon that was going to expire very soon which prompted our visit during that evening.
 

 The place was a bit tattered but the decoration was quite good and aesthetically appealing. At their waiting lobby, they have a golden throne that you can sit on to take pictures which is a nice addition. I understand that this place has been renovated a few times and the newer decorations look really good. I love the open concept of the whole lobby. It is spacious and I feel as though this place is absolutely perfect for an organized event. However, I would say the immense amount of space went against our favour because it created a lonely and awkward atmosphere as we were the only customers at the time.
 

 The service was good, nothing to rave about. It was casual, friendly, and hassle-free. We recieved our order in a very efficient manner -- only a couple minutes after ordering. I mean, it's not impressive as we were literally the only diners at the time but nevertheless we appreciated it.
 

 As for the food, I enjoyed it. We order modestly as we were using a Groupon but the food was greatly portioned and overall tasted average to good.
 

 Beef with Mixed Vegetables: I enjoyed this dish; in terms of taste, I found it quite under-seasoned but I really liked the presentation and it tasted relatively average maybe even better than other Chinese restaurants.
 

 Steam Prawn Dumplings: Good. My only complaint is the steam basket it was served in left a very unappealing mark on our table and I presume this is how they serve it everytime which is quite peculiar.
 

 Hot and Spicy Shrimp: I would order this one again. I thought it was super nice and the light batter paired really well with the shrimp. The seasoning and garnish was very good. I enjoyed this dish; It's simple but satisfying.
 

 Overall, I would not come to this place again. I feel like their prices are quite steep especially in comparison to other places. It was a decent experience but it did not surprise me nor leave a memorable impression. Even with the Groupon, it was quite overpriced which is depressing.",0,-1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,-1,0

  As for the food, it was great. Truly great. The steak was cooked exactly as I asked and the sprouts were delectable. While I had seen the menu plenty of times, I completely forgot the choice of sauces you could choose with the steak. I usually get mine plain as the seasoning alone is enough.

 The setting is beautiful and winter or spring time in Tuscon is definitely the right time to be here.
 The natural setting is the best thing about this location as you are miles away from the city and nestled at the base of the hills. Morning breakfast rides (horseback or mountain bike) are lovely as well as most sunsets.
 The horseback riding is very enjoyable, the wranglers are very friendly and helpful to those of us who remember very little of what we once knew of riding.  
 But...
 1. The facility is a bit run down.
 2. The food is very disappointing. The website leads one to think it's a foodie destination. It is not.  
 The breakfast, lunch or dinner buffet was inedible, worse than any airline food I remember.
 The best meal we had was the chuck wagon barbecue under the stars. Anything prepared in the kitchen showed poor food quality or preparation, service was slow, and selection was limited. They offered a by-request chef special at lunch which I had great hope for - 3 days and three tries - strike out.
 3. During our 3 day stay they were way over booked and the staff were running wild trying to keep up.
 4. The grounds crew chose the busy Easter week to put topsoil and fertilizer on the courtyard lawn outside our room on our first day there. Very aromatic. 
 5. For a desert destination I was surprised how small the pool was. Pool towels were always out, lounges are in short supply, and when the kids all come in from their afternoon activities... well even the most kid friendly of us have a limit of how many and how loud we want to enjoy.
 5. The management staff were just plain disorganized. They lost an Amazon delivery I had shipped there and weeks later, have now just found it. While I was there they didn't seem to make much effort to locate it.
 6. They offer various activities which are very enjoyable, but I found it frustrating that though I can rent a mountain bike and there are miles of trails around there, they only offer guided groups to ride - solo rides are not allowed.

 Visited on 7-7-19 at 12PM. The Sunday brunch buffet is $55 for adults and our 4 year old was free. Our server Nathallie was very attentive yet unobtrusive. 
 

 The buffet had loads of options and was clean and replenished often. The middle has a pasta bar, an omelette bar, and about 20 hot burners full of everything from sirloin to sea bass to cinnamon French toast. They have loads of fresh seafood, sushi, vegetarian options, caviars, and pastries. 
 

 I had shrimp which were outta-this-world amazing. They were plump and juicy and cooked to perfection. I also had two different types of salads and roasted veggies which were delicious. 
 

 The dessert area is overwhelming in the best way. Every single thing looked exciting and tasty which made it super hard to just pick a few. I tried the coconut cake, ice cream, a pecan tart, a macaroon, and a lemon cupcake...each one was fresh and decadent.

 1/5 the service is laughable from the staff to management. This is very disappointing both sides do not seem to care about their job.

I sat at the bar I was not greeted by the bartender who was talking to his coworker also at the bar who happened to be sitting NEXT to me.

 Food:

 Why I am so angry:
 The people around me were rude and it was embarrassing to be sitting near them. I talked to Bryan or Brian the manager and he seemed to not care about any aspect of his job. If someone is saying from beginning to finish their meal is bad don't offer a coupon fix it now. Please just don't go it's not worth it.

 The bar area is dark and carries a certain gravitas, however, the outdoor and side eating area is nice and bright. Table service is excellent with nice, crisp linens, attentive service, and polished silverware. Their wine list is more than passable, dare I say impressive, and more to the point, they serve reds correctly decanted with appropriate glassware. 
 

 There seems to be daily specials, which is promising. I had the Salmon, Goat Cheese and Strawberry salad, and my DP had the Grilled Swordfish with couscous. The bed of greens for my salad was fresh and varied, and the Swordfish, in particular, was grilled to perfection. This bodes well for their steak selection, although I did not venture into that territory on this occasion.
 

 I liked that the service kept our water glasses filled, and brought lemon and lime slices with the bottles. This was a nice touch. The menu is varied and large, very steak-house in feel, although there seems to be a brasserie vibe as well. I particularly enjoyed my Cape May point oysters, and was surprised with the fresh horseradish, cocktail sauce, and mignonette which accompanied the appetizer. My DP was a fan of the avocado toasts, which evince a certain trendiness, however, not overly so, since instead of the obligatory whole-grain bread, they opt for a neatly-sliced toasted baguette with almost a bruschetta feel to the dish.
 

 Overall, I was impressed and certainly would be back. The clientele was an elegant crowd, and the prices were slightly higher than most locations in the area but the more sophisticated dishes, service, and atmosphere more than made up for the slight premium. 
 

 Why a 4? It sounds picky, however, the bathrooms, as someone else aptly noted, are not at all high-class.

 The price was reasonable for bbq. Good Bbq can be expensive. Especially when you pay by weight. But the price per lb of each item was comparable to many other bbq places.
 

 I tried a few things to get a good sampling. Spare ribs, pulled pork, brisket. I asked the people working if there was anything else I should try. They said no, so I don't feel like I missed an important item or signature dish. Still, with everything I ordered it was pretty forgettable bbq. 
 

 The spare ribs were very ok. They were cooked right, but the flavor on the rub was almost non existent. You got no real flavor from the bark. There was a beautiful smoke ring, but they must use a mild wood, because the smoke flavor was tame too. 
 

 The pulled pork similarly was light on flavor. Fortunately, the pork was high quality so the meat was able to speak for itself. The. Best bites of pork, where the ones where you could get some of the bark with some of the juicy pork. Again, light on the smoke flavor.
 

 The brisket was also very good, but light on flavor. I understand wanting the meat to shine. I can see why that would be the approach. But it lead to a very forgettable experience.
 

 If you are going to let the meat speak for itself, you should have deep complimentary sauces. The sauces were also regrettably forgettable.
 

 This was a very average bbq place. Not bad by any means. Not great. Better than bbq chains by a mile, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way to try.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,1

 Ambiance/Decor:
 The restaurant has good ambiance- decor is nice and modern, but somewhat rustic. There is a nice bar area with high top seating. Tables are wooden and glossy. The seating against the wall is missing some buttons and the soap in the bathroom was watered down to the point that it didn't make any suds. The restaurant seemed clean. Menus were large and double sided and laminated. Kids menu were printed with a maze and a few things to color. Overall, it had a good vibe and they played good music. 
 

 Service: 
 Our waitress came over right away to get our drink orders. The kids ordered lemonade and water, I order a rosé that came bottled. She came back to let us know there was no lemonade, which the kids were sad about. She dropped off the mini bottle of rosé but forgot to bring a glass for it to be poured into for quite some time. Taking our order was admittedly not easy with one vegan and one person with a severe dairy allergy. She handled it well and was able to make some substitutions and reassured us about the safety of the food we order for the toddler with the milk allergy. 
 

 Food:
 The kids had pancakes, bacon and eggs and all seemed happy. The toddler with the milk allergy ate bacon, eggs, and French fries and he also loved his food. The adults ordered banana French toast (bananas were not ripe but French toast was good), vegan tofu scramble (which was fantastic and served with the tastiest potatoes, but was also the only true vegan option on the brunch menu), pancakes, grits, and home fries (also happy with his food).

 PROS: aight first of all, I gotta give a shout out to their Tupperware. Cute, tight seal, microwave, and dishwasher safe. That they let you take home!!! FREE TUPPERWARE Y'ALL. So the food is also a big win. Nicely seasoned, beautiful texture to the noodles and the crunchy toppings are a nice addition in flavor. The crabby mac's crab topping was delicious. It tasted pretty legit and didn't make the mac and cheese heavy at all. The chicken bacon ranch on the other hand was pretty hefty. Creamy and fatty and everything that comfort food is suppose to be. The portion size is just right in my opinion. I didn't feel super bloated after eating everything but it did sit a bit more after a while.
 

 CONS: I would say it's just a bit overpriced. Would I pay 7-9$ for mac and cheese every now and again? Sure. But it's definitely one of those ""treat yoself"" things.

 The drinks taste great, the food and service are pretty impressive but could be a little less on the price when looking at the comparison to their closest competition. 
 

 The meal is served like all basque family style dinners. You get your soup, then salad, beans and your entree along with a hearty helping of fries. I went with the oxtail, which was great. Two of our group got the strip steak and it came closer to rare than medium rare which was ordered. The lamb shank looked amazing and came out perfect. The only thing missing was the typical first course that comes with many basque dining experiences. Usually a chicken dish. The beans were great though of all the parts served before the entree.  
 

 If I remember right, a 10oz strip steak is about $7 less at Louie's, the other basque spot downtown in Reno and you do get the first course. Not that I'm trying to promote eating more food than needed but I would love to see both successful in town and feel like there will need to be a closer price point in the end to make sure there is enough business spread around.

 Right off the bat, this place has an inventory valued at $21K, so they have games for everybody. From Cards Against Humanity to Risk to Chinese checkers and everything in between. We came for a specific game but I like that you can come in with zero plans and fall into something you've never tried before while enjoying food and drinks. 
 

 The premise is simple: $5 fee per person to use the game, but any food or drink ordered can whittle down that fee. As you can imagine, the tables don't flip super quickly because people are spending longer with the games so this is a smart way to ensure some profit for them. 
 

 Additionally, I really like how the wait staff operates. You have a plastic flower pot on the table with three colored pivoting flowers. One color means ""we'd like food,"" one color means ""we'd like drinks,"" and one color means ""we need help figuring out the rules to this game."" This ensures they aren't interrupting or hovering if you're deep into the game play and don't want to be distracted.

The first night we had just flown into Nashville for the first time. Bartender was warm & welcoming. Drinks & burgers were great. We were the only people there. We were so happy. Wrote a 5 star review! 
 Came back a few nights later & there was live music, but the place was packed with a young drinking crowd so we left. Then, we tried it again our last night in town. Different female bartender than the first time. This one ""carded"" my 70 year old husband who ordered a drink. (We walked over from our hotel & he didn't bring his ID - why would he need it?) Right? 
 So I gave her my ID; which she made me take out of the plastic window of my wallet & hand to her. She still didn't make the drink. When questioned she indicated it was the law to card everyone regardless of age. We spent 7 days eating and all over the city. We patronized many bars, honky tonks, restaurants all over the City & not once did we get ""carded"". I later found out that it is not the law to card someone regardless of apparent age. 
 So, feeling pretty annoyed, we order food for dinner. After she takes the order, she asks for a credit card to ""run a tab"". A tab for what?? The drinks we can't have? So I ask her ... she says she can't order our food without a credit card. Seriously, we didn't have orange jumpsuits on! Did we look like criminals? No wonder there were only 2 people in the whole place. I tell her we are paying cash - did I need to pre-pay for the food like McDonalds?

They put out food that is not over sauced or anything else. There are plenty of pizza places in Newtown, Meglio use to be the top until Acqua e Farina opened up. Acqua is of a different level. Acqua easily becomes more go to when I feel like driving into town. However Acqua does not deliver..so Meglio maintains dominance here. Compared to Dolce and a few others, Meglio manages to perform consistent. Food arrives hot, etc. No real complaint.
 

 Where Meglio's falls short is quality. I'm happy to see Acqua in Newtown providing some real competition. I look forward to when DeLorenzo opens up in Yardley. The direct competition will not really be affected, but when I feel like driving, I will probably choose DeLorenzo's as my main go to. I think Meglio's can improve with adding some better quality products. I'm not saying rid of your lower end products but.. for heavens sake.. can someone in Newtown please make a real cheese on par to at least Geno's, Pat's, Steve's and Dalessandro's? There's a lot of issues I have with the quality of the ingredients. A slight step up would go a long with.
 

 Regarding the new store, I'm happy that Sycamore St got an additional upgrade, however the parking is simply terrible. Why didn't they just make the one side an exit or entrance instead of closing it off. Open it up and make it one way. Right now the parking lot is what prevents me from actually ordering take out or sitting in; I'll order delivery - but that's when I'm not in the mood for driving - if I'm driving it's to another place due to my issue with the quality of ingredients.

It has large windows facing its southern exposure, making for a warm seating area even on cold days. It was so bright at my booth that I had to close the shades to keep from sweating. 
 

 There were only four other tables occupied when I arrived. I was greeted promptly and escorted to my booth. Coffee and menu arrived moments later. I hadn't been inside a Denny's in years, and my memory of Country Fried Steak was dominant in my head. I ordered that. It included two eggs (scrambled wet), and rye toast, in addition to the unlimited java. Service was friendly and timely. I was approached every few minutes as to my satisfaction and needs. Never felt neglected. 
 

 My tastes have changed since the last time I had this breakfast in my early twenties. I remembered the crunch and meatiness of the steak, but had forgotten how heavily cloying the gravy was. I was able to remove a lot of it, but it was still a strong element of the meal, making for a salty and overly caloric feast. Still, the eggs were done perfectly, and their home fries were nicely crisp. With the three mugs of coffee I drank, it was a filling meal. 
 

 Not sure there will be a next time, as, obviously, I seldom have the urge for Denny's. Yet, it was a decent, if salty, breakfast. It briefly connected me to my earlier life, and alerted me to how my tastes have changed.

129087,1syjZi_hzVIYR2-XfY3knw,"Kiwi, as in the fuzzy skinned fruit, is also a nickname by which people from New Zealand are called. Also the name for this Boise downtown (Cultural District) bakery serving up - no surprise - New Zealand savory hand pies (mostly animal protein filled but a couple of veggie ones too), sweet treats (like Afghan biscuits which I highly recommend), good coffee and beer on tap. They also serve milkshakes but on the day of our visit it was mugs of hot chocolate (with whipped cream) being carried by the counter staff to several of the tables around us. Which in everything is connected to everything else mode leads to one of the things we most enjoyed and were surprised by during our first visit here.
 

 VIBE: We were expecting uber industrial vibe of very high ceilings and rough finishes given Kiwi sits on the 8th & River Street corner first floor of Phase 1 of the two phase 'The Afton' condominiums. It was that.
 

 Given the location we were also expecting this might be ""WHAT DID YOU SAY?"" pumped up music volume hipster hangout. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was none of that.
 

 It was quiet on the day of our visit but for the happy buzz conversations of people around us. In fact no music at all which we found ""ahhh...some"". Hoping that was their SOP, we asked. The staff said the golden silence was only because they had been so busy no one had a chance to reset the music when it stopped.  
 

 It also had a sense of ""all people are welcome here"". And I noted in the time we were there of the roughly 25 human beings present, 11 were under the age of 8 years old.  The children sitting at several tables with parents there were talking to each other - some while drinking aforementioned hot chocolate - with not a single cell-phone-head-down posture in sight. And at one table a mom and dad with their young sons in tow had a pile of books in front of them (the library is across the street) and mom had one son on her lap and one standing alongside as she read aloud to them. Books. Real, honest to goodness books being read by parents to children here. We loved it.
 

 The hitch in the giddyeup that is likely not fixable for this space is the two story big windows, some of which seem to be doors that could rollup in warm weather months, mostly face River Street which is due South. So full sun glare all day long and patrons - including us - were trying to find the tables with some modicum of sun protection and staff were having to shield their eyes as they took customer orders.  
 

 Seating includes standard height tables and chairs, which were the most popular on that day as they always seem to be anywhere, and high tables with stools too.
 

 EATS: The chicken and cranberry hand pie, straight out of the oven, was very tasty for the moist and savory chicken filling but relatively absent cranberry (jelly-sauce). The pastry crust was good and flaky. If I could wave a magic wand I would have it in the oven a bit longer for a little more toasty color and not quite as blond coming out. The Afghan sweet biscuit was excellent. As with the coffee.
 

 One each of the eats and one Americano shared by two was $15.
 

 Food is served on real plates with flatware, coffee in big mugs, water in Mason style glasses with metal straws. (I appreciate the environmental benefit of those straws but still unclear on how they are sterilized between users.)
 

 THE DRILL: Order at the counter and pay there, they'll deliver it to your table and bus when you're through. Friendly folks, but given they are pretty newly opened (maybe a month 'ish'...grand opening a week from now I think), they still have some challenges in keeping the savory and sweet cases stocked and having someone at the counter to take orders. Kiwi could as easily be 3 stars overall and not 4 for these things factored in. But that they are such nice people and everyone seems to be working diligently moves the needle up to 4.  I'm sure processes will all be addressed with time.
 

 ACCESSIBILITY: Level in from sidewalk, all on one floor, ample floor space, standard height tables throughout, all moveable if needed. NO accessible parking nearby, which is an ongoing City of Boise ADA failure and not the restaurant's issue.
 

 PARKING: On street in the main, although there is also a for pay surface lot, packed gravel not paved, for now right behind the Afton off of Fulton Street. (Imagine this will be developed eventually.)
 

 FUN NOTE: TV over fireplace at one end of the space had sound off and New Zealand nature channel and then animations on. I hear they show soccer matches, with sound on, to appreciative audiences when the games are on.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18628,kQeC9TJhqekglataIDWM_g,"Bru Burger, Plainfield, is one of the newest of the many Cunningham Restaurants in the Indy area. This family friendly restaurant has a contemporary decor with a black and grayish color scheme with pho tin/metal doors and pho rivots. Really cute! The restaurant has a warm, laid-back ambiance even with the amount of hardscape in the restaurant. I love the layout from the large, black and chrome sofa and chairs in the waiting area to the dining area being broken into two sections with an open, spacious room. The very lovely, large bar is off-set by the patio with seating for many customers. A large TV is located on the back wall of the bar for sporting events. It's a very comfortable bar area to hang out for drinks, game or dining.
 

 This Pet Friendly Patio (leashed pets only) has four 2-top tables and six 4-top tables on a fully covered patio. The patio is recessed off the sidewalk and provides an illusion of some privacy. The open, black rail enclosing the patio area provides a light, airy feeling instead of clostrophobic stuffiness. A soft, gentle breeze made for a comfortable lunch outdoors today in 85 degree weather.
 

 Our server, Ella, was an excellent server who was friendly and professional. She checked back on us often, food arrived timely and Ella confirmed each item was tasty without problems. Our total experience went very well and we'll certainly be back.
 

 You'll find a large craft beer list with signature cocktails and wines. Husband started off with a Zombie Dust which was ice cold and refreshing. Unfortunately Bru Burger serves Pepsi products so I stayed with lemon ice water.
 

 The menu offers appetizers and shareable sides, fresh salads, Chef and classic burgers or sandwiches. Yes, it's a classy burger bar but with tasty appetizers, salads, vegetarian and gluten free options.
 

 I started with a cup of the hearty chili toppped with diced onions, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. The small portion size was perfect as an appetizer. For my entree, I ordered the large portion of Gorgonberry Pecan Salad with Blackened Grilled Chicken. The salad consisted of spring mix greens, gorgonzola, cranberries, candied pecans, bacon and cranberry- poppyseed dressing. The salad was lightly dressed instead of floating in dressing. Plus the dressing wasn't overly sweet and blended well with the salad toppings.
 

 My husband had the Regular Burger topped with Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion and served with excellent French Fries with their delicious, homemade ketchup. The burger was perfectly cooked as requested and flavorful. He was very happy with his selection and said he was glad we came today.
 

 Dessert selections range from heavy peach bread pudding, lighter cheesecake, Root Beer Floats, Bourbon Brownies or ice cream. I desperately wanted to order the Bourbon Brownie but I was stuffed. Thinking back, I should have ordered to go and went straight home to the fridge.

The portobello mushrooms are sliced long and thing which makes them the perfect burger topping. The bacon was very crispy and you get two thick strips. The bun is homemade I swear! My burger was all that I wanted: flavorful with fresh ingredients. My sweet potato fries were crispy and salty to balance the homemade apple butter to dip them in. The apple butter was thick and cinnamon rich but not overly sweet.

We had ordered the pesto fusilli, sausage rigatoni, corn and goat cheese ravioli, and a sausage pizza. I was happy to say that the entrees didn't disappoint either. The flavors were all wonderful and didn't overpower the taste of the pasta itself. The only reason this place is getting 4 and not 5 stars is due to its slightly high pricing.

172620,JI_HBrHy-LvFAvwDvPOSAA,"I was so happy to spy, with my little eye, Panca as I was coming and going weekly to and from Plaza Mariachi, Mas Fresco and Taj. I executed an internet search and I found I had discovered a Peruvian restaurant. I knew a little about their cuisine from television but I was ecstatic to try it for myself.
 I've been four or five times and I'm a little embarrassed to admit how little I can comment about their menu because I get the chicken EVERY time. I'm determined to look up some recipes to better understand what's going on with the spice on said chicken but suffice it to say - DANG, that is good chicken.
 I had friends that went without me, so not really good friends because who would leave me behind on such an excursion, but friends nonetheless who noticed that there are two types of chicken to order. That actually mortified me that I didn't notice that detail right away. Anywho, there are rotisserie chickens and char-grilled chickens, and while both are good and seasoned the same, I've settled on the char-grilled version.
 While the spices remain a mystery, I had one for lunch today and there is definitely lemon juice involved.
 Two sauces are available, one verde one mayonnaise. The verde is similar to the creamy green sauce offered at every taco stand everywhere in Nashville and is apparently made with cacahuate or peanuts. I never could have figured that out until I befriended a chef from León, Mexico. Thanks Chuy! The Peruvian verde sauce is probably jalapeño, but who knows? The mayo has mystery spice in it, I'll see if I can't figure that out too. Both are addictive and go well with everything.
 I've enjoyed all the sides I've had except for the coleslaw. It reminds me of Colonel Sanders, not my cup o' tea, chopped up too fine and too sweet. The plantains are extra caramelized and gooey sweet.
 They offer several steak dishes, ceviche, fried trout, a couple of linguine - one with steak one with chicken. I must pry myself from the chicken to try these. Who am I kidding? Maybe after another dozen chickens.
 I usually go to restaurants at off hours to avoid the crowds and lines. I found myself there today at high noon. It wasn't too busy on a Monday and it was the best chicken I've had there. It makes sense, they want their chicken to be at peak freshness when they're busy. Two of three hours later it's not optimal.
 The sides are served from a steam table, and they load you up. No small plates here. They have a purple drink that is hibiscus flavored they call chicha. It's called sorrel in Jamaica and our Mexican friends just call it Jamaica which they pronounce ""Ham-ai-ca."" It has a wonderful light cranberry/grape flavor.

I placed an order for pickup since it was the only place still open on Sunday offering a shrimp poboy-and I needed one BAD. Ordering was easy, though payment wasn't taken over the phone, nor was a time quoted for pickup. I headed over right away so I could pick up the food while it was still hot. I paid and luckily my order had just come up, in fact I paid two minutes before I got the text saying my order was ready. 
 

 The poboy was about an 8"" pistolet, but the bread was a little spongey and dense. The shrimp kept falling out as I tried to eat. It was unevenly dressed with all the lettuce and Mayo back at the crease. The bang bang sauce that I thought would be smeared inside was actually poured in a corner of the to go box, so my poboy was covered with sauce on the outside? It really seemed odd as they included a whole separate container of bang bang sauce that was still tightly sealed. 
 

 Additionally, a side of fries were nearly $3 so overall the price for the size of the poboy and fries was on the higher end of things comparatively. Three stars for now, but not a spot I'd continue to go to for shrimp poboys.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Lucky Accomplice stands out to me due to their unique and original takes on dishes. Def worth a try in STL. 
 

 Our favorites:
 First off, their potatoes. YUM. Roasted taters with Gruyère mornay sauce topped with welcomed dil/herbs. 
 

 Deviled egg hash brown - another great medley of ingredients and flavors
 

 Pancake - fluffy and served on cast iron. Topped with berry jam and ricotta. This was a surprise favorite. The jam was not sweet at all which we loved and pancake was very light, fluffy, and just a few degrees from being runny in the center
 

 Pretty good:
 Weiner and eggs - pretty good. Menu said it had cabbage but it was not present when it was served to us. Served on the same bed of potatoes that we had already ordered and eaten. So specifically based on what we had ordered, this felt like a repeat dish so I'm being harsher here. But it's very solid if you hadn't already ordered the side of potatoes and devoured them earlier. 
 

 Pork collar hash - I looked forward to this the most but the pork was surprisingly dry and tough. It's cooked with a gochujang-esque sauce which was too sweet without any balance of acidity. Served with sweet potatoes. So double sweet and lack of balance. 
 

 Miss:
 Shrimp bisque and grits - I've never had a shrimp and grits dish that I didn't like until now. The other reviewers were right on. The ""grits"" are made from larger kernel hominy variety. And sad to say I did not enjoy it one bit. The shrimp and the sauce/bisque was too fishy in an unsavory way. Only one person from our group liked this dish and she is grew up eating hominy.

222350,TPzkOZY7msXg67v0VdfOvQ,"We finally got to try Kimbal Musk's other Indianapolis restaurant today. While we enjoyed it and likely will go back, it was not an unmitigated success. First, we were there shortly after 1:00 pm and while it was busy, there were several empty seats and tables and we were able to be seated right away. Unfortunately, it took an inordinately long time for our server to notice us and we sat, and sat. When she did find us, she did not deliver water. We noticed that every other table had a water bottle on it and water in glasses. Long before she came to introduce herself, we had fully decided on our order. We were, therefore, uninterested in giving her a drink order first, awaiting delivery of the drinks and then giving the remainder. In fairness, she did get comfortable with our desire. But we had to call her back for water. We started with a cauliflower salad that had curry overtones, golden raisins and chickpeas. That was a delicious dish, the best one that we had. Today's special was Baja fish tacos. My spouse ordered those and shared. They were only okay and not distinguished from any others we have eaten at other emporiums. In other words, we would not drive to Next Door for the fish tacos. I ordered the Next Door 50/50 burger - 50% beef and 50% cremini mushrooms. It had cheese and grilled onions on top and a very nice bun. It was superior to the fish tacos and I would order it again (the ultimate test). My spouse paired her fish tacos with a Scarpetta Pinot Grigio which was just about perfect. I ordered the Oren Roe Sharecroppers Cabernet Sauvignon. It is a lightish cab (and not terribly expensive) which paired well with the burger. Places must be reviewed within their own genre. This place is not intended to be a white tablecloth fine dining establishment. It is intended to be, and is, very casual in decor, food, wine, everything. Mr. Musk did a wonderful job of redoing the interior of what we remember mostly as 7-11 food market (and IGA before that) where, in fact, we used to shop. One other strong positive is that there appear to be menu options for a variety of tastes, e.g., vegan, gluten-free, etc. And there is no denying that Mr. Musk's mission is much to be lauded.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Let me start by saying they change their menu seasonally. I had eaten their buffalo wings as a part of their winter/fall menu and they were good. Pretty standard. I went in last week and noticed the menu had since changed and their new wings, I forget how they are described, looked pretty good. I figured I would give them a try. Ladies and gentlemen...I present to you...what heaven tastes like. The wings themselves and covered in this dark, thick, savory yet sweet, ooey gooey sticky sauce that made me question why I had ever eaten any food before in my life. Yeah, they were that good. But then...just when I thought I had found what I would now choose as my last meal, I dipped a wing in the sauce. Holy lord almighty!!!

213192,4aJzlHWt-XzNSDdEccB0MQ,"I was foolish enough to visit Moon Wok for lunch on Mardi Gras day. The food was fine, but the place was a mad house! The inside was closed--takeout only--and they weren't serving their regular menu. As there were very few options to choose from, I got tofu pad Thai (not usually a favorite), spring rolls, and the ""big ass"" sweet tea. They're not kidding about the latter--it's frigging huge!!
 

 Well, maybe my hunger amped up the flavor, but that pad Thai really hit the spot. Truth be told, it did not display what's considered the correct balance of salty/sour/sweet--it was mostly just salty and sweet--but I must follow that with another truth: I really didn't care. It tasted delicious, authenticity be damned. The noodles were well done and fully saturated with sauce, and there were just enough scallions and bean sprouts thrown in for texture. There was plenty of crispy tofu, and the dish was topped with fresh limes and a generous mound of peanuts. 
 

 My one gripe was with the red pepper flakes; I'm not a wuss when it comes to spice (I've been known to drink salsa like shots) but somebody dumped waaay too much red pepper in one corner of the dish, making part of the noodles inedible. I still managed to eat some by mistake, which resulted in a minor bout of indigestion. I'm all for hot peppers, but please PLEASE put them in a separate container next time.
 

 The spring rolls were decent--nice and fat--and the sweet peanut dipping sauce was excellent. They were coming apart a bit; not so fresh that day, perhaps?

I do regret not coming here earlier though, because this restaurant is outstanding and I had been missing out! The portions are quite generous for the quality food and price. Since this is a family-owned and -operated business, a young boy served my table. He was cordial, helpful, and considerate throughout. I asked him for recommendations and his picks (which are also the most popular choices) were the big quesadilla or the huarache.
 

 The following had been ordered:
 1. Big Quesadilla (Steak)- Not your typical quesadilla, as I would even contend that this is so much better. Assuredly, this was spectacular! I loved the homemade corn tortillas. They had the perfect crisp texture. The steak was not a very fatty cut, which I appreciated. The cheese has a pull to it. I can comprehend why this is a popular choice.
 2. Huarache Azteca (Chorizo, Steak & Chicken)- This also used homemade corn tortillas and everything was cooked to perfection. The meat was grilled with a good amount of seasoning. The avocado slices were bright, fresh, and ripe. The ratio of everything in this dish was just right. All of the ingredients combined together made this dish very flavorful. Don't just take my word for it; try it yourself!
 3. 3 Tacos (Campechanos, Asada, and Pastor)- The most favored of the three tacos was the campechanos one, which consisted of steak and chorizo. The least favorite was the pastor.

377927,nLFzzIsOxwiAbynpciqsng,"Keke's Breakfast Cafe is busy on a Sunday afternoon. We waited about 15-20 min for a table. They conveniently have beepers to call us. There's inside and outside seating, so we waited outside because it was crowded in the lobby. 
 

 Four of us were lucky enough to sit at a 6-person table to fit our appetite. Since it was my first time, I was ready to order what sounded good.
 

 Drink: Large OJ ($4)
 Entrees: Florida Waffle - Belgian waffle with strawberries, bananas & blueberries and whipped cream (optional) ($9.99) 
 Eggs Portobello - Poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce, portobello and roasted red peppers on an English muffin, with a side of home fries (loaded with cheese & bacon (+0.50)) ($10.99)
 

 Everyone else had breakfast combo platters.
 

 Presentation was beautiful. I got my food first, but waited a few more min for the others' food to arrive before I dug in. I was a little disappointed that my poached eggs weren't the expected runny eggs, they were nice and plump but were more of a medium-soft hard boiled. The hollandaise sauce wasn't that flavorful like others I've had. I added hot sauce to give it a kick. The home fries were just ok. Even when I added pepper, and the melted cheese, it was still kind of bland. The Florida Waffle was good, but nothing to wow about. There was plenty of strawberries and bananas, but very few blueberries that were hidden in my whipped cream. I almost thought they forgot to put any in there. The fruit was fresh, but the bananas tasted a bit bitter, probably because they were still green. I tried some of the other's food. The Banana stuffed French toast was good, it was soft and sweet. The Breakfast Salad is more like a fruit parfait. It was honeyed yogurt topped with strawberries, bananas, blueberries & granola. It was a bit overly sweet because of the honey, and bitter because of the bananas. We didn't end up finishing it. 
 

 Overall, food portions are rather nice and hearty. I was impressed with our tall juices. Service was great and our server was kind enough to give us all the hot sauces available. I just wasn't impressed with the lack of flavors in my food. If it weren't for great company, I probably would've sent my eggs back to remake. Everyone else's food seemed fine. They had the perfectly cooked eggs, crispy bacon, plumped sausages, toast, and large pancakes. I probably won't be back for awhile. I've had better brunch elsewhere with the same price point.

 I love visiting bakeries, but not usually for the bread-y, cake-y or pastry options. I usually hope they have some kind of chocolate mousse or a good-looking cookie or brownie. I began that search at this place. The young man behind the counter wanted to be helpful and started offering samples of all the things I would never choose. Something called a Buttering with marzipan and later a fruit torte. The Buttering looked like an enormous Cheese danish, which has never been my thing - carbs that taste stale and lack the artistry and sweetness I crave. And marzipan? That dense, overly-sweet stuff that's used for making cake toppers?? Yeah, there was no way I was gonna like that. HOW WRONG I WAS! This pastry was absolute perfect. The marzipan was light in texture - like a cheesecake. It wasn't overly sweet. And the pastry itself was light, sweet and moist from absorbing a little of the marzipan. If I lived here, I would plan brunches all the time just so I could buy one of these to set out. 
 

 The fruit tart was nice as well! The cream had just enough sweetness to balance the fruit on top. And the fruit didn't have that obnoxious layer of sugary goo painted on top. 
 

 Hubby is a huge fan of pastries and a huge fan of apples, so we also got a slice of apple strudel (currant special). I'm not usually crazy about these either. But again, the pastry was impressive and the apples inside were perfection. They didn't taste like they came from a fan but had been baked, sugared and seasoned to perfection!

 Lunch: 
 

 The young girl tending bar was friendly and attentive. Took care of getting me an ice tea and gave me​ some time to narrow​ down my decision.
 

 I went with the Oyster Po Boy ($16,00) breaded, fried oysters with lettuce, tomato and remoulade sauce on a hoagie roll. I was blown away by the number of oysters. There were a lot, and they were crisp and sweet. The remoulade was nice, but the tomatoes tasted like they were on the verge of going bad and didn't​ really bring anything to the sandwich anyway.

 I ordered​ the Oysters Rockefeller ($12.00) six oysters with creamed spinach and hollandaise​ and chorizo. It was good, but a little bland and the ​addition of chorizo didn't do much for the dish.
 

 For my entree,​ I had the Bayou Gumbo ($20.00) Shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage, rice, okra, ​and crusty bread. It was a good size portion but underwhelming. It had a decent amount of shrimp, crawfish and andouille sausage, but only a few tiny pieces of okra.
 

 But, it was super flat for gumbo, it was lacking seasoning and also that rich depth that comes from a roux being cooled out and developing earthy flavor.
 

 So twice in one day, the ​service was warm and friendly, but the food was ​average. The ONLY saving grace was that we have Club Savor and our entrees were half price.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They were seasoned well and had great flavor, and so tender and yummy. They served them with two sauces, one sweet bbq and the other a hot sauce. I preferred the sweet as the dry rub already gave the wings a spicy kick. I got a small order of tots on the side, a nice change from fries and they were crispy and good also. I've heard that they do ""dirty tots"" where they add mountains of other delicious things on top so that may be a future order! My friend got the pulled pork sandwich and it was very good also.

 The food was great. I had the seitan wings and the seitan Banh Mi and both were wonderful. The spices and sauce used for both were excellent and the seitan was cooked to perfection. My husband got the regular wings and commented they were a little dry. His burger was good BUT he ordered medium well and it came out medium rare. Typically we would have sent it back since he has a sensitive stomach however we waited an hour and 25 minutes for our entrees. I think he would have eaten the plate if they told him his order was out. 
 The server kept apologizing and a manager came over to apologize as well. We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a huge deal but our friends did have their toddler who was (for good reason) getting impatient. Our reservation was at 7:45, we thought we'd be out the door by 9 instead we didn't get our meals until around 9:20. It seemed as though someone lost our ticket or something because the tables on both sides of us, who were seated well after we were both got their food before we did. I am going to assume this isn't the normal occurrence over how apologetic the staff was. They did comp our appetizers and one dessert which was very much appreciated. I would certainly give Bernie's another try because as I said the food was wonderful and the recovery efforts of the employees were great, mistakes happen but they recovered very well. 
 

 One tip-the floors were very slippery and they did not have out any caution signs. It was raining the night we went and I slipped going into the main dining/bar area. I'm 5 months pregnant so thank goodness I caught myself. My friend also slipped on the way out carrying her toddler. So tread carefully, literally.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Their menu consists of Italian dishes as the name suggests. They have the round style pizza and the square style found in Rome. In addition to traditional pizza and pasta found in Italian restaurant they carry grain bowls and dinner items like New York strip steak. 
 

 Having just come back from Rome myself, I was feeling nostalgic and ordered the square pizza. I opted for funghi. The truffle cream gave the pizza a lot of flavor and and the mushrooms were well seasoned. They have many other flavors of pizza that I am interested to try out.
 

 I shared the pizza with a friend but I could have easily ate the whole thing myself. We had a side of calamari as well and it was pretty standard for calamari. 
 

 For a drink, I had the Paloma. It is like a margarita but with grapefruit juice. It was flavorful and the right balance of alcohol and ingredients.

 The whole process is streamlined and reminds me a lot of the chain &pizza (which I love). You can opt for one of their recommended combinations or to make your own. I was in a rush, so I tried the signature pizza 'Kennett Square'. It had herbed butter, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, and topped with arugula, goat cheese, and truffle oil. 
 

 The crust is not bad, nice and crispy, but not as chewy as I like. My main letdown was how skimpy they were with the toppings (besides the mozarella cheese, which there was WAY too much IMO). However, I was happy with the amount of goat cheese. I had the equivalent of maybe 2-3 mushrooms worth of slices and about 7-8 sprigs of arugula. And the pizza was overly oily and lacking any truffle oil flavor. 
 

 Compared to their counterparts, the value just isnt there. The customer service was subpar-- no one seemed to know what they were doing and I even had to remind them that I had yet to pay. I have had wayyy better pizza elsewhere and for the same price.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
522889,8d8tWT6XrR618PthYjJnsg,"Land Ocean (2 locations in NoCal) has ventured into Treasure Valley (Ustick and Eagle, in the Trader Joe's shopping center), and we headed over after church for brunch to test drive the place. Still in the soft opening stage (doors opened 11/26) it's a tender time for any new restaurant and the parking lot reflected that. We really enjoyed our meal there, so I hope this review helps fill that lot up a bit. 1st, the interior ~ love the vibe, warm tones with white, 2 level booth/banquette seating, bar central in the room. Not overtly large, supper club'ish ambiance. Not to be confused with prissy or pretentious - neither the vibe or menu project that. Proper professional employee etiquette, from reception to serving staff, I like that. Complimentary mini blueberry muffins; we added bottomless mimosas ~ a good way to start. We ordered the Ahi Poke Taco appetizer bc we're suckers for Ahi and Taco in the same title. They were delicious. Hubs had the Italian Sausage and Bacon Skillet, which he pronounced yummy. He's a GF kinda guy so passed on the gravy; but I can attest to its texture and balance of flavors being just right. I ordered Crab Cake Benedict, daring choice for a first date with the kitchen. Crab cakes were generous and properly presented. My tastes lean toward a bit more seasoning, but the mango hollandaise was unique and worked well with the crab. Kitchen struggled a bit with a medium poach on my eggs, but I allow that they are still getting their land legs back there and I'll try this dish again. Breakfast potatoes were perfect texture, seasoned properly and we did them justice. We finished Brunch with an Apple Crisp - not that we were still hungry - the kitchen has a great feel for providing without portion overkill - but it's a fave and needed to be sampled. Arriving with standard vanilla ice cream scoop, the balance of sweet and spice was good, not spectacular, and even apple slices in prep will improve the finished texture at presentation. Final note: I'd like to see the kitchen provide some GF prep options because a lot of folks require that: but based on our overall experience I'm going to give Land Ocean a solid 4 stars; not bad straight out of the chute. Definitely worth a visit and now is the time while there isn't a line out the door, because I think Land Ocean will develop a fan club.

 It was all you can eat Hibachi and sushi. We were greeted immediately upon arriving. +
 Our drinks and appetizers were taken and we waited for our chef. He could have been more enthusiastic with his technique. I have been to many hibachi (Chicago was my fav) and I know the flair it can have. We had some first timers I wanted to impress. 
 The food was delicious. It got quite busy and hard to get refills but they did come around for food refills. 
 The only lyrics issue is you have to pay extra for fillet, scallop and lobster, no problem. But you have to also pay for each refill of these. That is not AYCE in my opinion. I would rather see a higher up charge for AYCE than $6.95 each 3 scallops.

 I think that their Buttermilk Fried Chicken rocks the roof off Teddy's. Great flavors, lovely smashed potatoes, and the green beans are garden fresh from the local farmers garden!
 

 If they are busy you can eat at the bar. Cool selection of draft beers and area wines do the trick.
 

 The Cobb salad is really nice, with fresh salmon. A lovely dinner with the family is fun, sit out front in the patio, or inside at a giant booth or hide out in the back patio keeping it stealth. This is Carp.

 We popped in shortly after opening. The buffet was fully loaded & ready. 
 

 They had the typical fare with my favorites tikka masala & tandoori chicken. They were missing my favorite saag paneer- I love that stuff but the chicken curry dish they had was an excellent substitution with strong curry flavor in the sauce. The tandoori chicken was perfectly cooked & not too dry. They had a good selection of wings & breast which was nice. 
 I enjoyed the tikka masala but will admit the flavors were a little less rich than I'd like. I love the typical strong Indian seasoning but it may not work for their typical crowd or maybe I went on an off day. 
 

 At the buffet they also had a small Israeli type salad- the chopped cucumber with mint & tomatoes. I love that & was thrilled to see it since I missed my greens in the form of spinach. 
 Their additional sauces/seasonings/dishes of condiments were fantastic. Intense, spicy flavor. They were really really great. 
 

 My husband gave their flat bread his stamp of approval too.

 You probably want amazing pretzels. Which I want, too. And they have them so everyone is happy. 
 

 I sat outside but I didn't hesitate to take a gander at the interior before I settled down. There isn't a bad spot in the whole place. I've been inside Das Bevo before it changed hands. The new owners did a great job at renovating it. It has a modern appeal but still maintains the integrity of the original architecture. I love the inside but the outside might be better. STL has great patios but our overall patio game is weak. Das Bevo adds to that with a huge and beautiful biergarten. Dare I say, the best in STL? I suppose that's a matter of opinion but it's top 5 no question. 
 

 They have a great beer selection at amazing prices. There are steins and ubersteins which are just giant servings. Always go for the uberstein... it's more cost effective so you gotta. I've had their pretzels which I approve of but I need to come back for a proper meal.

 Upon entering, we were greeted with smiling faces which is always a warm welcome. They're pretty busy, but we're able to get seated right away. The first thing I noticed was the decorations and set up they have.. it's a very rustic feel, which I love. 
 

 My cousin and I decided to get a few things and split it all. We got the 2 egg hash which came with bacon, potatoes, and pepper blend. I really enjoyed this dish. I thought everything was cooked and seasoned very well. However, according to my cousin they do change up the hash dish on a weekly basis which is a bit of a bummer, but leaves me curious as to what they will have next tine I'm there. We also got 2 crepes. You're able to choose if you want them to be savory, sweet or both. We decided to do both. For the savory we filled it with spinach, bell pepper blend, chorizo, & mozzarella. It was good, but the chorizo was a bit too spicy for my liking.. I would prob opt for bacon or sausage next time. For the sweet crepe, we got PB and banana. This was AMAZING!! If you're a peanut butter lover like myself, you won't be disappointed. It's seriously PB heaven!
 

 By the time we're done with everything, I had zero room to try the macarons or other desserts that they offered so that will be on my list of things to try next time I return.

The salami was ever so slightly brown and crispy on the outside and warm and soft in the middle. Cheese was melted into the amazing tasting bread. Came with a side of black olives and peppercinis.

 Burgers- Holy, moly. The Provencal Burger gets me every time. I just can't seem to order anything else. Complete with basil aioli, marinated red onions, herbed goat cheese and sauteed mushrooms, I'm a huge fan.

 When you walk in, they tell you to seat yourself, unless it is super busy. There is seating outside and inside. There is also a bar area to sit at to wait for food, drink or eat.
 

 We were seated quickly and brought menus and water. The menu is pretty verse considering how small the restaurant actually is. They denote GF on the menu (see below) and have a section for vegetarians. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the menu and took our order quickly. The food came out fast and hot. The flavor was consistent throughout and no extra salt, pepper or sauce was needed. The restaurant was impeccably clean and there was music playing.
 

 My sister got the fresh tofu rolls and tofu noodle soup. She said the soup was great but she would order extra vegetables next time.
 

 Gluten free: I was impressed that the menu is labeled GF for Gluten Free. There is a note that you do need to ask for Gluten Free sauce (I have made it a point to say something regardless.) There are plenty of options. There are appetizers, salads, bowls, pho and rice dishes. I had the Spring Rolls with Shrimp. They are gluten free, the sauce is not. They were rolled perfectly and did not come apart as I was eating them. I wish there would have been more mint in them but they were yummy! They brought me gluten free soy sauce but I didn't feel I needed it. I also ordered the sliced beef pho. The Pho is served with Hoison sauce on the side which is not GF. They brought out a small plate (in comparison to other Pho places - it was small!) of bean sprouts, mint, basil, jalapenos and lime. The flavor was good and the sliced beef had good flavor and there was a lot of it! Next time, I would add the steamed veggies as there are really no veggies in it. The waiter also brought over a spice tray. There were four different items on it. One was brown and I'm assuming that was Hoison because it was pointed out to me that it wasn't gluten free. There was also chili paste, sriracha and chilies which were all gluten free. Don't ever be afraid to speak up to make sure that things are gluten free if you need that. Please remember after reading this that you still may need to ask to verify.

I was severely disappointed by the flavors of the soup and the texture of the noodles. I felt like I was eating packaged ramen noodles for $14.50 a bowl. The noodles were very thin and stringy like the package you buy in store compared to other ramen shops I've gone too. The broth flavoring was honestly disappointing, while it lacked flavor the flavors didn't melt right. Just tasted too salty and pungent. I had then moved onto the mochi matcha cake and was disappointed in this dessert as well. Going in I knew the cake would have a different texture due to the mochi aspect, but there's hardly any flavor to the cake and it's like chewing bread that's like jello.

 The wait to get our food was about 15 min which seemed long to me when the restaurant was mostly empty at 2pm. My salad was a little bigger than a side salad. It consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, a few slices of cucumber, tomatoes,onion, feta, & a side of dressing. This is not a Greek salad!! Where's the olives, pepperocinis, the scoop of potato salad??? The dressing wasn't right either. Now to the chicken gyro. It was bland & there want any taziki sauce on it? So I asked for a side of it. My mother says taste this, it's NOT Taziki. She was right it was puréed cucumber with what tasted like sour cream? Taziki is a yogurt sauce seasoned & cut up cucumber that tastes WAY better than their version.

 They have 2 medium sized rooms with a bar in the middle connecting them. A good amount of seating. We came here on a Saturday during college football and the bar area was full with a couple people here and there in the dining areas. They have really big, new, nice TVs that are showing all the games. They have cheap drink specials and food randomly throughout the week (usually at night).
 

 We ordered a couple beers, and their special steak sandwich. It was probably a 8-12 ounce steak cut in half and both halves put in a deliciously flavored piece of toast
 

 Honestly, this might be my new place for game day, whether it's Thursday night Football / NBA, or Saturday / Sunday Football.

It all started when I walked into the restaurant and the girl at the counter looked at me as though I had paint smeared all over my body. I asked her if a booth was available, to which she replied ""No we have no more booths, but I can seat you at a table"". This caught me off guard as I could see two opens booths. I immediately called her out on this & showed her the two open booths. She tells me she can sit me at one, and that she will have to clean it. I sat in the booth after she cleaned it and tried my best to put the situation pass me. This was red flag number one! 
 

 After a while some time had gone by, and a server didn't come to my table to take my drink order, nor did they come by to deliver the standard salsa and chips. I usually give myself ten minutes, and if no one shows up to the table then I will walk out of the restaurant. Just as I am about to leave, the waitress appears with salsa and chips, and takes my order for a drink. I was getting odd vibes from her, something was just off. So I place an order for chicken fajitas and she says that they will be out in a bit!
 

 While waiting I taste the salsa and chips and noticed how bland the salsa was. It was like someone poured tomato juice out of a can and added some onions! This salsa was beyond watered down. Whoever is making this needs to fix the recipe ASAP! That salsa belonged over pasta if anything! 
 

 15 minutes later my chicken fajitas come out. The flavors were okay, portions were generous, they were seasoned but nothing too extravagant. I needed a spice kick, so I asked for some hot sauce. To which my waitress brought me a small bowl of tomatillo sauce. THAT IS NOT HOT SAUCE!!! So at this point I am just through, and I notice that my waitress is nowhere to be found. Additionally what I noticed is that she was giving a better level of customer service to people who I assumed were regulars. This is sad, because I believe that equal service should be delivered to all patrons. 
 

 After finishing my meal I paid and then asked for a bag, to which my waitress replied ""she'd be out with one."" Eight minutes go by and no bag comes, additionally I see her once again interacting with her regulars. I get up from the table and get a bag from the front counter. I left with my stomach full, but with residual energy of awful service and bitter food flavors as well. 
 

 This is not a Mexican restaurant. Tex Mex if anything! The food here is watered down and inauthentic. Please have your staff learn about and study authentic Mexican cuisine. Tomatillo sauce is not hot sauce! Additionally, customer service training is a must for the staff here as well!

The nachos had mounds of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole, which for me is like heaven. Another friend at the table ordered the fish sandwich.

470937,BfdGQ8qj7T3abSvl54MjUw,"Ever since the folks behind some of my favorite Philly restaurants (e.g. Dos Segundos, Khyber Pass) announced the Royal Sushi and Izakaya concept in the early 2010s, I eagerly tracked the place's often fraught progress. Izakayas, with their grilled meats, fried delicacies, and energetic feel, remain some of my favorite places to eat and drink, and Philly has a frustrating lack of them. Happily, Royal mostly delivered on the promise of delivering a reasonably authentic izakaya experience to the city, and a recent dinner here met my expectations.
 

 Royal's fairly small dining room could use more light, as the menu is difficult to read given the dim lighting. Major props for playing anime on the projector, though. Our server helped us navigate the menu yet remained unobtrusive throughout service. The drink selections here are heads and shoulders above most Asian places in the city; there is a large selection of sake, cocktails, and beers (including rare varieties of Hitachino on draft) that go well with the food.
 

 We ordered six dishes that arrived more or less at the same time. The small size of our table didn't accommodate all of those plates comfortably, so pace yourself to ensure you're not crowded out by your food. In regards to the food itself, it mostly was memorable. Miso soup is usually a throwaway, but here it tastes deep, rich, and almost nutty. Steak tataki brought perfectly juicy slivers of meat cut with a bright sauce of lemon and soy. The takoyaki had fluffy, creamy innards studded with chunks of octopus and doused in delicious sauces and bonito flakes. Our kushiyaki sampler did justice to Japanese skewers; we particularly enjoyed the bacon wrapped scallops and shiitake mushroom varieties. Two dishes we ordered, the pedestrian pork belly bao and overly salty Kurobota sausages, failed to impress as much.
 

 Royal Sushi and Izakaya represents one of the more authentic izakaya experiences around, and that warrants a visit in and of itself.

This was one of the problems. Her lemonade tasted off and had a hint of orange with it like it was run through the hoses that once carried orange soda. Not a good lemonade. Wife's pulled chicken sandwich had good promise, but was overcooked and dry. It also was about half the size of the roll it came in. The peppers and provolone helped somewhat, but she felt that a chicken sandwich from even a fast food place would have been better. I had a beet salad which was pretty good with goat cheese, mandarin oranges, and pistachios with mixed greens. The balsamic dressing was on the side which also was nice. I enjoyed my salad along with my Franks Black Cherry!

Greeted by a staff which was seating people we opted for the bar. We walked right up to the bar but we had to stand as the bar stools had been taken by staff for outdoor seating (live music.) 
 

 Bartenders greeted us immediately and offered us a drink. I opted for a Lagunitas IPA and he opted for a Jai Lai. It was happy hour which meant $1 off our draft pours. Winning! We stood around watching people and the MANY tv's and then ordered the special of the night which was Pirate Punch. Tito's vodka, pomegranate juice and a splash of sprite or club soda. It was sweet but the pomegranate cut the sweetness and added a bit of tart. We had a shot of chilled Titos just before leaving. 
 

 The drinks were well made and the food going out of the kitchen looked great. The man next to me at the bar ordered the boneless wings. Served in a nice white bowl on a bed of lettuce and a side of either ranch/bleu cheese. He devoured them so they must have been fantastic. I did not get a chance to look at the menu but I would return just for a chance to try their food. 
 

 Drink prices were fair and did not make me feel as if they were trying to take advantage of me. 
 

 We paid our tab and off we went. 
 

 All in all this was a great experience. The owneer/manager needs to purchase more chairs for patrons. They have live music all of the time. It is out on the patio. They should know by now (been open a long while now) that they need more stools for people to sit on. Don't steal the bar stools from the bar and make those patrons stand. They are not costing you a dime. They are standing at the bar letting the people less than 3 feet away from them get their orders. At least let them sit down and be comfortable. I am not going to take that out on the review or the pleasure we had while here. Someone, PLEASE tell management to get more chairs. Thanks!

We had trouble finding it at first because there are no signs saying Dosi Rak on Fletcher Ave. You need to look for the A-Green Supermarket sign which is located in a strip plaza on Fletcher. Dosi Rak is located inside the supermarket, walk in and go to your left. FYI despite the market being open til 9pm Dosi Rak is open until 6pm. Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners and orders taken. Took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready which was great because we walked around the grocery store and purchased some items.  
 

 It's a cute little quick service Korean restaurant with very limited seating. Don't expect to be greeted by anyone for seating. You walk up to the counter and place your order -- they have the menu posted on the counter and despite being small they have an array of our favorites. They have soup options, meat options. I ordered the beef bolgogi, my hubs ordered the jajajangmyung, my daughter ordered the spicy ramen with no veggies. My bogogi was served in a cute lunchbox type container that had kimchi, fish cakes, and rice. The meat was a thicker cut (I prefer the thinner cut) and the flavor was good but not the best as it was sort of dry. I would've liked to have had more flavor and sauce on the meat. My daughter's ramen she said was just ok as well -- noodles would've liked to have cooked longer so was more soft but the flavor was good! My hubs dish was the winner of the evening. Both me and my daughter kept digging off of his plate and he actually ended up finishing mine. Lol. We all agreed that next time we are all ordering the jajajangmyung!!

 I came with a friend for lunch, because we wanted to try somewhere new and had seen the awesome reviews. I generally like latin food, especially some good rice and beans so we figured it was worth a shot.
 

 When I arrived, I had to wait a bit for my friend to show up, so I perused the menu and watched TV. The environment is a bit dark and musty. It'd behoove them to get brighter lighting and spruce the place up a bit in my humble opinion. The server did come to check on me periodically to offer drinks and apps while I waited for my friend, so I'll give them credit for that.
 

 While trying to pick out what to eat, I decided to check in on the yelp app, of course. Lo and behold a check in offer popped up for a $6.5 special including 1/2 cuban with rice and beans. I decided I wanted to go with this, so I ordered it. A long time later the server came back and told me they're not honoring it anymore, but he'll let me get it ""this time"". Apparently based on previous customers reviews, they haven't been honoring it for a while, so why don't they get the offer removed?!

The set standards for excellence in food and service in this city are one of the main attractions that make New Orleans one of the best places on planet earth to visit. It was disappointing to me that this restaurant did not hit the mark.  I showed up with a party of five for a 7:00 reservation at about 6:45 pm. I always like to meet early for cocktails and to have the opportunity to socialize and to check out the place prior to being seating. Every restaurant in New Orleans has their own unique theme and set up that makes getting there early a big part of what I would describe as a dining adventure.

It is one thing to be busy at the bar and pouring drinks but our bartender was running around the place trying to solve issues with the dining room staff and the Maitre D' instead of paying attention to the business at the bar.

Granted, it wasn't as long as the line for Pancake Pantry across the street (probably because of Biscuit Love's seating process, which I'll get to) and not nearly as long as the line I've seen at The Gulch's Biscuit Love location on any given day. We waited on line for about 20-25 minutes on a rainy day and the employee manning the door was kind enough to pass down a few umbrellas. He was very friendly and engaged in pleasant conversation, which made a gray and rainy day that bit brighter.
 

 The seating process at Biscuit Love is kind of different: you wait in line to order your food, THEN you get seated. That way, your food is already being prepared as you get seated, shortening the wait time for your food and thus making the turnaround for dine-in customers shorter (and I want to say, helps the line move by more quickly). The menu here is smaller than other menus I've seen in similar places around Nashville though.
 

 I ordered Bonuts and the Princess sandwich. The bonuts were just alright -- nothing to write home about and I probably wouldn't order them again. They kind of tasted like large, sugar-coated doughnut holes with a weird, grainy texture. The Princess sandwich was delicious. It's Biscuit Love's take on a Nashville hot chicken sandwich on a biscuit. I will say, it's not as spicy as Nashville hot chicken I've tried at hot-chicken-specific places, but it was delicious nonetheless. As was the biscuit, because a place called ""Biscuit Love"" has to have perfected their biscuit. I also got cheesy grits as a side, which was really good and not too liquidy. My only complaint is that, even for a side, the serving of grits was pretty small.
 

 I recommend this place to anyone going around Hillsboro Village (which is a little town with nice places to window shop or stop inside), or to anyone wanting to try Biscuit Love but who's not willing to wait in the ridiculous line at The Gulch location.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Their oysters have the perfect ratio of parmesan cheese and butter - they are truly out of this world! During my visit, I also got to try their ""Taste of New Orlean,"" which comes with chicken & andouille jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, and chicken & andouille gumbo. All three were delicious (I would definitely order this entree again), but my favorite would have to be the crawfish etouffee as it was very flavorful.
 

 Overall, I highly recommend checking out Royal House! Even if you don't want a full meal, it's still a great place to grab a drink and enjoy some oysters. Next time I'm in town, I plan on asking for balcony seating for a view :)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The seafood here tasted fresh. The shrimp was huge and easy to peel. The crab is yummy. The clams and muscles were great and not sandy at all. 
 

 The flavor of these boils was lacking a bit. What they lack with spice they made up with butter. There was a lot of button on the crab platter.
 

 The 1lb shrimp we ordered was great, but again it was lacking some spice. The crawfish was the one that was seasoned the best. 
 

 The one reason why I subtracted a star was just how they packaged the food. It was very inconsistent. And I wish they would be a bit more consistent since how much sauce came in each order.

At $75/night for a room with 2 queen beds, the room was as expected: basic, pretty clean (although I strongly suspect it wouldn't pass the black light test), with no frills. It did have a small coffee machine and the usual amenities. All of the towels were dingy with brown stains, none of them nice and white. Gross. 
 

 The only reason I chose this hotel was to have the family see the circus acts and spend some time in the midway. The midway was okay, with lots of video games where you can win tickets and redeem them for prizes, like at Chuck E Cheese. These were interspersed among the carnival games where you can try your luck to win various cheap stuffed animals. The circus acts were on every hour and half hour. We watched 2 of them, the acrobatic trapeze act and the ""Chinese"" acrobats. The trapeze act was ok, reminiscent of the days when circuses were more common. There was only 1 Chinese acrobat, and he did many impressive balancing acts on a low wire.

 Leonardo's is a 24/7 Mexican joint, almost in fast food style, seems like they try to specialize in burritos but they have a lot of other stuff.
 

 Overall, nothing was awful but everything was lackluster. The chicken burrito was ok but it had too much sour cream and lettuce. The sour cream made the burrito a soggy mess. The shredded beef burrito had the opposite problem...the meat was super dry. 
 

 The overriding problem with Leonardo's was a severe lack of flavor/seasoning. Usually this isn't a problem at Mexican restaurants but wow does Leonardo's need some improvement in this department. Burritos were bland, even my dad's lengua, felt like the meat in all of them hadn't even been seasoned with anything. Beans were in desperate need of salt. My mom said her enchilada tasted like nothing, and the rolled tacos were similarly drab. I will say that their rice was good and their salsas were decent.

Hubby was at wok tonight while wifey ran register and answered phone.
 

 These folks have not lost a beat, either. They still don't deliver, but that isn't likely to change anytime soon. That, and a somewhat mediocre egg roll still leaves them at a good 4-Star rating. I'd say 4 and a half, actually.
 

 Queen Bee got her usual Krab Rangoon. I don't see how she likes a plain old fried wonton skin with cream cheese and krab juice. She does, though: especially here. Same holds true for her own thought process as I had the usual shrimp toast. Greasy, guilty pleasure that would make Forrest Gump proud. He'd also have to walk another 100 miles to burn off all those oily carbs...either that or keel over dead of a coronary after chowing down on these four bad boys!
 

 Wonton soup still yummy; good broth and some scallion pieces complement the non soggy and pleasantly plump packages of porcine pasta pleasure. Egg roll crisp and decent sized for a FL take out joint. A lot of bok Choi and carrot; little pork. Eh...
 

 Three items ordered to see if they still have it down in the old Doo Wok A Doo Department. General Tso chicken and also roast pork with snow peas. Last one was my go to pork fried rice. Queen Bee likes the first as a rule and she LOVED this rendition. Pieces of real white meat chicken still a little crisp and packed a wee bit of good heat at the end.
 

 Pork with snow peas also great! Generous amount of sliced pork, along with a nice load of tender, snappy pea pods, along with some bok Choi, water chestnuts, etc in a fantastic sauce. BTW: see those pictures I posted? Those were both the SMALL size!
 

 Pork fried rice was jammed to the brim of the oyster pail. They got it just the way I like: dark, well done and with a load of bean sprouts. Both of the owners are very receptive to special requests like this. I guess it helps that I know them and they recognize me. 
 

 Last item is that they put up plexiglass at the counter, and even had a mike-and-speaker system installed.

It would be similar to eating at an Indian, French, and Italian restaurant. You know someone just got overzealous with the options and didn't really consider the execution. 
 

 Located inside a Kroger shopping center, Sriracha is one of the newer Asian restaurants to crop up in Nashville. It's definitely not a fancy place by any means. There are booths along both sides with a long table in the middle. There's also several TV's on the walls for sports viewing.
 

 I was excited to see ""Boba tea"" listed on the drink menu, but they are all more like slushies with tapioca pearls. From what I can recall, they had coconut, taro, mango and strawberry. I went with mango flavored and it was definitely from a powder. More creamy than mango flavored. Only positive about it was that it wasn't too sweet. The tapioca was stuck in a clump, tasteless, and not properly cooked. Tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. They also serve beer.
 

 At a glance:
 

 For Japanese: sushi rolls, sashimi, yakisoba and teriyaki stir-fry dishes (which is not technically a Japanese cuisine to be honest)
 

 For Korean: bulgogi 
 

 For Vietnamese: rice entrees, spring rolls, banh mi (Baguette sandwiches), vermicelli dishes, Pho, and spicy beef stew
 

 Oh! And they also served hamburgers for those who aren't feeling the Asian vibe.
 

 For entree, I went with the Vietnamese vermicelli with grilled pork. Actually quite good. Meat was nicely seasoned. The vermicelli was served hot? This is typically a cool dish meant to be eaten during the hot summer months so I was taken aback to find my noodles were served hot. Otherwise, no complaints.
 

 My girlfriend got the Pho Dac Biet which she enjoyed. They do not give you enough garnish here. And were missing some key herbs. I tried the broth and found it flavorful.
 

 Prices are reasonable with most entrees being under $10. Service was friendly and attentive. Never was my water empty and all the servers took turns checking in on us. They have a tip jar here that is shared.
 

 Overall, since I do live in West Nashville and we have multiple options for Vietnamese food, I don't see myself venturing this way just to eat here.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 First, i'd like to address the band.  Good Laaawd they were awful. A bar like this should pull in better talent. A good band keeps the place buzzing and this band was way off the mark.  
 

 First mistake was not ordering beer from a place with beer in the name. Two bloody Mary's and two margaritas. All of which tasted watered down and not much flavor.  
 

 The server came and took our order without writing anything down. That would be ok if she remembered it all but clearly she didn't. The food began coming out and was dropped off on the table. We didn't have silverware, napkins or plates. Had to wave someone down for that.  We ordered 20 wings and got 10. My wife ordered a side of buffalo sauce that never came.  We ordered a supreme pizza without black olives adding bacon and jalapeños, cooked crispy. We received a cheese pizza with bacon, jalapeños that looked like it was cooked crispy. We explained the mistake and they removed the pizza. When the pizza was returned it was clear they took the first pizza, added the missing ingredients and put it back in the oven. Normally this might be ok but an already crispy pizza placed back in the oven produced a burnt pizza. Truthfully, I was shocked they even brought it to the table based on how it looked. Took one bite and it was full of burnt flavor so we said we didn't want it.  
 

 Here's the bright spot though. Every server we did speak with was very nice and they did apologize. The kid from the kitchen, think he was the expo, was super apologetic and really kind. The establishment removed the pizza from the bill and made us another one. Very unexpected and great way to recover.  
 

 Our daughter ordered a small pizza and the other ordered nachos. The nachos were very good. Putting them in the oven made the chips w crisp and had a good flavor. The pizza, didn't really have any flavor. They mention their sauce on the menu but the pizza (daughters and ours that was remade) lacked any sauce that we could see/taste.

 CHARCUTERIE BOARD 48
 

 A selection of freshly sliced meats and cheeses with seasonal accouterments of fruits, pickled crudités, olives, nuts, and our Cake Bake Shop jam. Served with slices of French baguette. Due to all ingredients being prepared upon order, please allow 20-25 minutes. Serves 2-4.
 

 It was fantastic, and beautiful, however it needs way more bread for 2-4 people, we asked for more and it was noted when the staff said ""I'll ring that in for you."" that we were going to be charged extra. That seemed petty especially given the very small amount of glittered warm bread that accompanied the $48 board. 
 

 I personally had: 
 GREEN GODDESS COBB SALADE 18
 Bibb lettuce with Romaine and Iceberg lettuce tossed in our homemade basil and garlic green goddess dressing, topped with oven-roasted turkey, crisp smoked bacon, eggs, avocado, fresh tomatoes, green onions, and bleu cheese.
 

 DELICIOUS! Fragrant fresh dressing, all the flavors were wonderful I would 10/10 order it again. 
 

 FRENCH ONION SOUPE 9/16
 Onions sautéed with butter, olive oil, cognac, sherry, and chardonnay. Cooked in our homemade beef stock. Topped with country French bread and Gruyére cheese. Served with half of a toasted French baguette and salted European butter.
 

 I had to order a cup after reading the description on the menu. Props to whoever wrote the description for this soup, well done. It was very good, so much so that I was picking the melted cheese off the side of the dish to eat it all! 
 

 WHAT ABOUT THE CAKE!? - Don't worry we had a piece and yes one piece was enough for all five in my party, they are huge slices so share accordingly! 
 

 RASPBERRY CHAMPAGNE CAKE 15
 Three layers of fluffy vanilla cake brushed with a French champagne simple syrup, filled with our private label raspberry jam and fresh raspberries. Frosted with our champagne vanilla buttercream and topped with fresh raspberries.
 

 Very good, the frosting is light and creamy, not overly sweet, I also noted ""Wow, you can taste the champagne!"" It pairs well with the ""Private (bougie!) label raspberry jam and fresh raspberries.""

(Spoiler alert: None of them are in the same league.) Through our visit, we had marked five places to get cheesesteaks while in town. Genos and Pats were more for their history and relevance than anything else, but it was nice starting here and working our way up.
 

 We had stopped by Geno's the night before since all the other places were closed. The next morning we came to Pats, since none of the places were open yet. I love that they have the food ready less than 20 seconds after you've placed the order. Wrapped and everything, but still assembled fresh. We also appreciated that they broke down the cheesesteak jargon on posters for us ignorant outsiders. We got our cheesesteak ""wiz wit"". Wiz for the cheese, which we had never heard of until coming to Philly. ""Wit"" meaning ""wit onions"", as opposed to ""wit out"". We loved it in Philly.
 

 The bread was soft, and the onions were cooked all the way. The meat was in full, thin chewy slices. They don't cut the sandwiches in half, which was unfortunate for us because we ate this one in the car outside of Swann Memorial Fountain. The sandwich was messy to the touch, it took some serious doing to get this thing into two pieces and eat it without cheesing up the whole car. But we managed, and we'd do it again.
 

 We voted Genos over Pats, and all other places over both. There's a lot of Kitsch surrounding both ""original"" locations, and it's made them both soft.

84718,gSrRreYHJy3WeurBgr3oqg,"Enter at your own risk. I have visited this place multiple different times over my last few visits to Nashville and aside from overpriced drinks have had a generally good experience - except for my most recent visit. 
 

 The long and short - security detail was way overbearing, to the point where not only was it difficult to enjoy ourselves, but where I was physically assaulted by security. Read on...
 

 It all began after my date was approached by a bouncer (for a second time), reprimanding her for something. Problem is that we couldn't hear what he was saying so we called for a manager. 
 

 In the process of trying to have a conversation with the manager, that bouncer joined in as well. So now all 4 of us are trying to talk to each other over the loud music so it was more like yelling. Their position was that since they had to approach us twice about violating rules that they told us we had agreed to upon entering, we were now being forced to leave.
 

 It wasn't clear exactly what rules we had broken. We were sitting inside the little box they put us in which was defined by red masking tape on the floor, large enough to fit only the two stools we were sitting on. The purpose of the box was to keep patrons socially distanced from one another. 
 

 The only time either of us had stepped out of the box was to go to the restroom (with our masks on). We were not standing up and dancing.
 

 The conversation with the manager and bouncer had become counter constructive, so I gave our bartender a $40 tip and out of frustration threatened to leave without paying. 
 

 Seconds later I found myself being lifted up off the ground and smashed onto the floor. I am not talking about being pushed or shoved back or blocked from leaving, but literally grabbed and lifted and then violently slammed onto the floor with a security guy landing on top of me. It was evident that he meant me physical harm.
 

 After getting up, a bit shaken, we paid the bill and left. 
 

 Over the next few days, I began experiencing an increasing amount of pain to the point where I saw a doctor and got x-rays only to discover I have a broken rib and massive internal contusions, making it not only difficult but painful to breathe and move. 
 

 I take responsibility for being a dick and attempting to leave without paying, but to physically assault your customer over a $100 bar tab is way over the top. Maybe in the 1800s but not in 2020. 
 

 The attitude and actions of the security personnel that evening were akin to the police brutality that everyone is protesting against - unnecessary excessive force from an overzealous nut bag with too much unearned authority. 
 

 So if you are in Nashville, I hope that my story can serve as a reminder of what you can expect if you step out of your little covid box one too many times. Don't try to stand up for yourself...or else.

 We honestly were only off for about 15 mins before we were seated in a nice center spot table / booth. The Malbec wine from Argentina was solid! We are already trying to find the distributor online..! Food wise, we were here before moving onward later in the night so it was crab poutine which was delicious. They also had a cheese board that looked fabulous. 
 

 Even after all this, the MGR popped by again near the end to wish us all a good NYE, and that again is what makes this place stand out already on 2017. Class service and attention to detail.

It was packed with lobster meat! Tender and delicious. However, the clam chowder was the star of the show for me. The bowl portion is HUGE. It was creamy and had big chunks of clam. My husband also loved it. I was able to get a free lobster taquito thanks to Yelp and that was also delicious. Everything I had was flavorful and the quality of the food was excellent. My husband had the clobster grilled cheese and I was able to snag a bite. It was loaded with crab and lobster and the sauce was delicious. I enjoyed the seasoning on the fries and they were perfectly crispy.

604710,VFmF_ZyfFH-ILwxJ55v7lQ,"Fiesta Guadalajara is an ""old school,"" family owned and operated restaurant, serving delicious Mexican cuisine that's based on the city that the restaurant is named after, Guadalajara, in the Mexican state of Jalisco. This amazing restaurant serves some of the finest Mexican cuisine the greater Boise area has to offer, and the delicious fare is served with a smile.
 

 We're still in the grips of the COVID-19 virus scare, so seating in the lobby is taped off. As you enter the restaurant, you'll be greeted by a friendly ""meeter/greeter"" who will seat you. On this late Thursday afternoon, the restaurant was sparsely seated, so our ""greeter"" suggested we sit anywhere that suited us. We decided to sit in the main dining room.
 

 Shortly after we were seated, our super friendly server, Nancy, brought out a large basket or warm, fresh corn tortilla chips, along with a small bowl of in-house-made salsa, and creamy beans, perfect for dipping.
 My friends are a little ""sensative"" when it comes to salsa, so I gave it the ""ol' college try"" and rated the ""heat"" level at medium-low, which works perfectly for me. My friends opted to enjoy the bean dip, so I got to eat the salsa all by myself!
 

 From the ""Combinations"" section of the menu, I ordered a #5, which featured a tamale, and enchilada, along with a taco. All combinations include rice, and either refried or ""whole"" beans. Like the ""Mexican"" I am, I went with refried beans, which are one of the foods that I LOVE the most. When asked for my choice of meat, I ""porked out"" and went with pork, all the way.
 

 Choices of meat for all entrees includes chicken, carne asada, pork or carnitas. Talk about a tough decision! I went with carnitas for my taco, enchilada and tamale, but I could have ""mixed and matched"" if I would have wanted to. Fiesta Guadalajara is very flexible, and serves YOUR food the way YOU want it!
 

 The carnitas meat in my meal was simply mouth-watering amazing, as it was juicy, tender, seasoned, and spiced perfectly for my taste. The enchilada was amazing, being stuffed with carnitas, onion and garlic, but the tamale simply blew me ""out of the water,"" as it was SO great! When you surround the juicy carnitas around perfectly prepared masa, a little on the crispy side, you go to ""Jalisco heaven"" without leaving the greater Boise area! My taco features carnitas, lettuce, tomato and onion, in a crispy, fried tortilla, that actually held together while eating it! The restaurant's chef has talent!
 

 The rice was great, but so-so, as rice never excites me. The refried beans... oh the refried beans! Now you're talking... the refried beans were creamy, and I could taste a little garlic and lard in the beans, which makes for outstanding refried beans! The beans were topped with grated, melted Mexican cheese which, along with the tamale, made me think I was dining in a restaurant in downtown Guadalajara, Jalisco.
 

 Do you love thick, flavorful red chili sauce? I do, and my dinner had lots of it from the enchilada and the tamale, which made for perfect dipping with my beans and rice. My enchilada, tamale and beans were topped off with two varieties of grated, melted Mexican cheese. Muy sabroso!
 

 My dinner was simply outstanding! My dining companions felt the same way, as both Cindy and Katie commented on how much they enjoyed their fine meals. Anyway you look at it, Fiesta Guadalajara is a fine restaurant...
 

 You'll love the food, you'll love the friendly service, and you'll love the ""old school"" Mexican-style dining room. The recent addition of an upscale bar and dining room is a nice touch as well.
 

 When you combine amazingly friendly service, delicious food, and reasonable prices, it all adds up to 5 stars for Fiesta Guadalajara.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is on a Sunday at 11:45AM so I highly adivse coming in by train if you dont mind going via train to save close to 20 bucks.
 

 Appetizer - Rip off of the day. $15 for a plate of meats that are very sparse. There is barely any meat on this plate seriously. About 4-5 olives and three bite sauce pieces of fresh mozzella with a pesto sauce. The mozzella is great with the pesto sauce but don't be a sucker and pay $15 for this app you have been warned.
 

 Food - Wanted to try the Shrimp Scampi which is NOT on the menu for lunch....ok next choice went with the bucatini pasta with cracked pepper, sprinkled with some pistasios, and foe grais. Very good, had a nice amount of garlic and/or pepper but was a great pasta dish and at $15 bucks its affordable for the city. Tried the famous meatballs that have fontina cheese in them...they are good - Are they the best thing since sliced bread? I don't think so but for some reason the appetizer portions size that people are posting of there meatballs look better then the meatballs that comes with there marque item, Nonna's spaghetti and meatballs (I know I am brining up price alot in this review but $18 dollars for lunch for this item and $19 for dinner for this item....whats the point of lowering the price point by one dollar guys or is this a inside joke for the owners?
 

 

 Fish - The swordfish at $12 was the steal of the day. Wonderfully grilled swordfish with tons of flavor in a lemon sauce. 
 

 Dessert and Coffee - The coffee is pretty good its La Colombe which is a nice strong italian pour. The desserts on the menu looked good enough to order by the menu descriptions but we were too full to try. 
 

 Did I have the overwhelming impression to run back here after dining here no not really. That being said they do pasta well so if that is what you are shooting for you will most likely be satisifed with your entree.

 I knew that they wouldn't have as many choices at this location as the main one in LA. But there were a few of them I was expecting them to have here but didn't, mainly the Philly cheesesteak hot dog. I went with the mulholland drive dog with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, nacho cheese, and bacon. The hot dog tasted good but the toppings didn't really work together well. The mushrooms weren't grilled they were the nasty marinated mushrooms that come in a jar that a lot of pizza shops use. And the bacon was kind of soggy, I would have rather had crispy bacon bites instead. The sandwich was drowning in nacho cheese. I'll have to make sure I substitute with a different cheese if I ever come here again. My husband got a hot dog with bacon, chili and shredded cheese on it and that one was a lot better. 
 

 The layout of this restaurant is not great either. It's in the center of the food court with a barrier surrounding it. If there's even a slight line it makes it very difficult to order because there's nowhere for the line to go, you have to stand right up against people's tables. I had to try to squeeze past this line and people's tables to get to the soda machine as well. And they were literally out of every kind of soda except diet soda. No regular soda at all; no coke, no sprite, no orange soda, No Dr Pepper either. I ended up going with some diet cherry sprite that was nasty because there was a huge line behind me and I didn't know what else to pick. The cashier at the counter should have informed us that they were out of soda beforehand, I wouldn't have ordered it then. And it's ridiculous to run out of that many all at once. 
 

 We came here like a week or so after it opened so maybe they needed more time to work the kinks out. I'm not opposed to giving this place another try if we happen to be at the mall and hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back either.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

452375,3E9oe98MuslioH150J0iew,"This brunch was INSANE and I am so incredibly happy we had a chance to eat here! My boyfriend and I woke up on a Sunday ready to eat, but we knew the lines for brunch and lunch would be insane. Luckily, I noticed that French Toast features the Yelp Waitlist feature, so I added our names to the list while we walked the 20-minute journey to the restaurant. It felt really comforting to see our place move up in line in real time. We used those extra minutes beforehand to explore the French Market a bit nearby, and before we knew it, our table was ready.
 

 We were seated at the counter, and were overwhelmed by all of the incredibly unique brunch options. I started off with a pomegranate mimosa (YESSSSSS!) and my boyfriend ordered an Irish coffee. These were the best decisions. If you want something cold to drink, I recommend that mimosa, and for something warm, go with the coffee! I dare you!!!!
 

 Picking something to eat was extremely difficult, because *everything* looked incredible. I wavered back and forth between the fried oysters avocado toast (c'mon, that sounds ridiculously good) and the king cake french toast. I ultimately went with the french toast, which was a very, very good decision, because it was stuffed with cinnamon cream cheese. How dare they, honestly?! How dare they come up with something so fantastic?!?!
 

 Along with our individual meals, we asked for an order of aebelskivers, because we saw pretty much everyone around us eating these powdery treats. If you're even mildly curious as to what these would taste like, ORDER THEM. Just do it, and get the jam to dip them in. The aebelskivers here are warm, doughy, and topped with powdered sugar. Like a lil' beignet. This was the perfect addition to our brunch!

 So, he added more orange juice, and was nice about it, but it was still undrinkable. I told him I was I sorry, but I absolutely hated it and wasn't going to drink it.

 I returned early afternoon and was kindly greeted again by Stanley. I opted to get my meal to-go and eat it at home since I needed to be efficient and productive today. The meal consisted of a fruit salad (peach and blueberries), a salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and the main dish which had more than enough seafood in it (three large unpeeled shrimp, mussels, squid) and some sort of sausages in the rice.
 

 The rice is arguably the most important ingredient in paella. Fox Park did not disappointment. This dish was cooked with love. The rice absorbed the fluids of the dish and not too mushy. I'm not used to the rice being charred, but this added dimension and made the dish it quite enjoyable -- it was like a BBQ paella. The squid tender and not chewy. I applaud Fox Park Smoothies use of the large shrimps; however, it made the meal messy having to individually peel them. Personally, I don't mind if an establishment does not devein shrimp; however, other patrons may have some qualms about this -- so beware.
 

 I also had a piece of carrot cake and appreciated that the cinnamon was not overpoweringly strong in the dessert. Stanley snuck a few other goodies into my bag -- which I will have later.

We used to live in this area and often-times frequented this location, but haven't visited in a couple of years. Upon entering the location, I immediately noticed the trash on the floor. The hostess greeted us (we appeared as a party of 3, but had someone else coming) and said, ""Two?!"", I was immediately confused! I told her there would be four in our party and requested a booth. She told another host where to take us and she rushed ahead to clean the table.
 

 The tabletop was wiped, but the floor under the booth contained empty creamer packaging, menus and straw wrappers. We should've left then, but alas, we stayed. Our server, Alan, introduced himself with a stretch and a yawn and asked if he could get us started with some drinks. I asked if they still had Cherry Limeade to which he responded that they didn't have the mixers yet and that I must've come from Avon. I explained to him that I used to order it all the time, so they must not offer it any longer....and no, I do not hail from Avon! We ordered our drinks and the birthday girl ordered a cake batter shake. We waited an unusually long time for the drinks to be brought out and when they were delivered, Alan said he'd give us some time to look over the menu. We'd had enough time and opted to place our orders then. When my daughter tried her shake, she realized that it was Strawberry and not Cake Batter. I waved our server down to let him know and he got the right one brought out.
 

 The food came out shortly thereafter and everything was fine with the food. My girls requested some additional condiments and the server returned with one of the two requests. I should add that Alan doesn't write anything down, but his memory isn't that great. Shortly thereafter, our fourth arrived. Alan was right there when she sat down, but didn't bother to stop by to at least get her drink order. She stated quite loudly that she already knew what she wanted, but perhaps he didn't hear. He disappeared into the kitchen while we exchanged hellos and small talk. 10-15 minutes passed and he still hadn't been by. I got up and peered into the kitchen until I saw Alan pass the doorway. I told him that our guest needed to order. He nodded in agreeance, but then came out and greeted a new table that had just been seated.
 

 When my aunt ordered, she noticed that the server appeared to be nodding off during their exchange. She spoke slowly to make sure that he was getting it all, but he appeared lethargic...or bored, I'm not sure which. Needless to say, our experience was the opposite of good. The restaurant was dirty, the service ""meh"" and when my daughter visited the restroom, she said there was toilet water all over the floor. I took her word for it!

The edamame hummus was okay. It was creamy, slightly sweet and sour, and was lacking in flavor overall. It reminded my friend and I of a crab rangoon without the imitation crab meat and with the addition of sesame seeds. We ended up ordering the chicken katsu, white tiger roll, drunken fish roll, and fried green tea ice cream. The chicken katsu was underseasoned but was better with the rice and the katsu sauce. The katsu sauce was very sour and overwhelmed the dish as a whole. The white tiger was fine. However the calamari tempura in the white tiger was a bit soggy. The drunken fish roll was good but the shrimp tempura was not crispy and there was nothing special about the roll. My favorite of them all was definitely the fried green tea ice cream.

He was nice and friendly. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and a small wing order which he explained would've been ""buy 10 wings, get 10 free"" all for a total of $13.01 with tax. So that's what I ordered. As he reviewed my order, i asked for flats for my lemon pepper wings. He had already closed the order back and ran back to tell the staff to make them flats. Should've been no big deal right? 
 

 Well the wait time for my order took a total of almost 35-40 min. Michael was nice enough to offer me a drink in which i was appreciative. 
 

 They do this thing where they show your food that you ordered before you leave. Good thing i looked because they definitely short changed my wing order. If i ordered 20 wings i expect 20 wings. Nothing less. There were about 7 of lemon pepper wings and 8 of the buffalo wings i ordered. My order was all messed up. So another guy sent my food back to give me my correct amount. When we went to count the wings he decided to hover his finger over my food to count them like a 5th grader. They weren't even all of the flats that i ordered but I was just so frustrated and hungry, i was ready to go! 
 

 As far as the food, it was fine. I feel like they felt some type of way about short changing me my wings so they just threw some plain fried ones in the mix because they didn't have any seasoning on it. 
 

 If you can take anything from my review i would say:
 

 MAKE SURE YOU COUNT YOUR WING ORDERS because they can short change you and you won't even recognize it. It happened to my husband once before.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The hostess was super nice I told her we wouldn't mind getting a table inside or outside, whatever was faster. She told me the wait would be about 20 minutes. She took my phone number down and exactly 20 minutes later called to let me know she had a table inside ready for us! Upon looking at the menu they had so many great options. Their prices are phenomenal! The dishes we ended up getting were the Tasso Shrimp and Grits, Very Berry Waffle, and the hash browns. I don't even like grits but when I saw the server bringing this dish to a table I had to have it. The dish came on this almost looking cornbread with 2 huge eggs on top. The amount of shrimp given was perfect. The sauce that the shrimp were in was just amazing! The flavor was everything! The little salad on the side was a mixture of amazing citrusy flavors. Amazing amazing flavor! My taste buds were so happy! The Waffle was so fluffy and just right! Fresh fruit was a plus. The hash browns were delicious! I like to drown everything in ketchup, but the seasoning was so great that I didn't even need any. The hash browns are big enough to be split FYI.

The restaurant has a dark, old school, The Godfather sort of vibe - stained glass lighting fixtures, booths adorned in floral tapestries, and big, bulky carved wood dining chairs - and instead of being dated it felt charming, intimate and classic. The service was prompt and attentive. Before our meals came we were impressed with the abundant bread with butter, giant antipasti salad and yummy bowls of minestrone soup. I ordered the scallops and fettuccine and while the scallops could've been prepared better (they were a little rubbery and seemed steamed rather than seared till golden), I still really enjoyed the dish.

 The last two times my food has taken so long that I had to leave before I got it. A 25-40 minute turnaround is about right, but 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes just isn't reasonable. The manager has been rude and curt but I'm assuming overwhelmed as well. 
 

 The times I have gotten my food have been underwhelming (compared to what it had been in the past). 
 

 In addition, they've been closed so much it's hard to know if/when they're open. They have the ""Labor Shortage"" signs up in the window. There is no such thing as a labor shortage unless it's WWII and 29% of people are being hauled off to Europe and other places to support the war effort. No, this is a wage shortage. Basically, wages don't meet demand. Don't let anyone fool you, people want to work, just not for $4-12/hour with no benefits, breaks, hectic scheduling and unplanned overtime. 
 

 Sadly I feel as if Lift is on the downslope.

 Location-wise it in an location that is currently being revamped to bring much needed thriving businesses to the area. There is no dedicated parking lot, however there is street parking. Best thing is they have security/detail out front at all times which is perfect. 
 

 Upon entering, you are greeted by very personable host/server. As part of covid guidelines they are requesting everyone sign in. The interior space is fun and cute. As of current, not too many tables are placed to enforce social distancing. 
 

 I had the pleasure of being served by the ever-so great Jaylah. She was great at communicating & took her time explaining the menu. She genuinely seemed interested in making sure we had a great dining experience.
 

 We of course was there for happy hour which where you get 2 drinks for 1. We got the peach and strawberry margaritas and they were delicious. Mixed well to perfection.
 

 We ordered the Steak Dinner & the Crawfish and Hot Sausage Quesadilla. Normally my guest and I love to time from time order is taken until the food arrives and in this case it took 27 minutes. Upon getting the food we of course were wowed with the food and how great it looked. The steak dinner itself can literally be shared with 3 people due to its huge portions. My guest initially stated that most of her dish not hot, but more so warm which was actually the same case with the quesadilla which seems like it sat for about 10 minutes or so before it was brought out. However because we were enjoying the environment we made due. When it comes to the quesadilla, I think a waiver is needed as it was beyond on fire with every SINGLE bite. I could barely eat it honestly but I made due.
 I do see great things for Nice Guys NOLA and a bright future as it is clear that everyone single one of the staff including the owner takes pride in every thing that is done.

554342,0d4injfSfSuE2Vh_chFjHw,"Bottom line: Pretty good food, nice ambiance, decent service at expected prices.
 

 Food: Had the baked drum and half dozen raw oysters as well as the key lime pie for dessert. The oysters were fresh and delicious and at $1.30 each, pretty decent value (non happy hour or anything). The baked drum was good- the sauce was delicious and they give you 3-4 hush puppies which were also good. Fish itself was tasty though I did want a slightly larger portion. I wish they provided some bread to sop up some of the delicious sauce but even after asking, apparently they don't really have any bread, which seems like a shame and also kinda odd for a restaurant like this. The key lime pie was good but not particularly amazing. 
 

 Ambiance: Liked the atmosphere- casual yet modern. 
 

 Service: Friendly but a little on the slower side (ie for taking orders, getting food out etc)
 

 Value: oysters were good value, baked drum at $24 was ok but something like $18 would have been good value. Key lime pie was $8 which is pretty standard but again, just wasn't that amazing.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
572866,VKZkG3-VNaIBpSD9boN_Rg,"I was expecting alot more but it fell flat for me. Hubby ordered fried chix sando. Chicken dry and overcooked. Pizza tasted like store bought frozen. My 9 yo who loves pizza would normally eat an entire mini pizza. We bought her a kids pizza. She only ate 1/2 and that with 4 of us taking a sample bite off one slice. 
 

 They make flat breads Breads were thin and dry.  They cracked and fell apart when you bit into them. They only cook the beef well done or medium. Ordered my La Jolla burger medium and I found the meat too grissly and dry. It looked great though but taste was ok. My eldest daughter got the lunch special that came with fries and a drink. Again..burger and bread too dry.  
 

 Burgers were small so I am glad we got onion rings. These were so moist that I thought the were batter was undercooked, but my kids liked them considering everything else was dry. We also ordered the wings. Didnt realized they were boneless. These looked and tasted very much like the frozen Tyson chicken nuggets you buy at the store and you just pick the seasoning you want to add to it. 12 nuggets for $11.99 was pretty pricey for what appeared to be store bought. Some highlights...service..fries..garlic ranch dressing and fountain drinks. Garlic ranch dressing was addictive. We used SO much of it to moisten up our burgers and to dip our ""cracker (flatbread)"". Glad it was self serve for their condiments as we would have been too embarrassed to ask for so much.  Fountain drinks. Drinks not watered down like most places. Nice! Hard to find a place who doesnt water down the drinks. Fries were so tasty and crispy. Garlic ranch was perfect addition. The ""homemade sauce"" tasted like the one the Cheesecake Factory serves. As my family said..next time we will just come and get a bucket of fries and dip in the dressing and get some fountain drinks. We would be very happy!
 We came literally as the cashier was unlocking the gate. There were about 15 customers waiting to order. She was friendly and sweet and knew her menu well despite sharing with us that she had just started working there. Customers had questions and she had all the right answers! I have to mention that there was one male staff who seemed a tad older who just stood behind the bar giving her orders...she was restocking the condiminents, handling the register and even delivered one of our items to our table while he just stood behind the bar watching her. I felt bad as when she had rung up all orders and there was no customers waiting to order I hear him say ""I need you to bring in the 2 pots of bird of paradise from the outside in. You know where they go right?"" Before she could answer, he points to the area inside the restaurant. These were not small. Here is this big heavy set guy asking this thin young female to move this heavy item. I was embarrassed for him as he just stood over her and watched her as customers walked by.  He was ""manning the bar"" with no one ordering. She was awesome. Not one complaint. After she was done, she ran back to the register as there were customers who were waiting to order.
 If we were in the area and wanted a snack on fries, yes we would come back. Sadly, this place is pricey considering for what you get. Small ""burger"" alone at about $10 will not be enough. You will need to order more to fill up.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So, my group is known for finding killer brunches, and when we all headed to Tampa for a wedding, this was the first place that came to mind.

The unlimited mimosas had slightly more Vitamin C (i.e. OJ) than my preference, but being they were unlimited, no doubt we got our share of champagne that day!

 The fish is obviously smoked fresh everyday. They do everything right here. Just old school Florida St Pete-Style. The fish dip is Mullet and Mahi. It's my favorite smoked dip ever. 
 

 They also smoke other fish including salmon. I just appreciate the casual Florida beach feel and they service is great. Eat there and take something to go.

 One of those ""old familiars"" was Tammy's International Pizza Sensation, a divey little pizza joint you couldn't help but love located in a fairly non-descript retail spot directly across from the Indiana Government Center. 
 

 When the Government Center pretty much sent most employees to work from home, that spelled doom for many of those area businesses that relied on that business and convention foot traffic. 
 

 Tammy was a delight and it's sad to see that pizza joint go away. The good news is that a new pizza joint has taken its place, Pronta Pizzeria, a Hispanic-owned place opened up by Carlos Lopez that is just as simple, just as divey, maybe even a little bit better in terms of taste, and an absolute delight in terms of customer service. 
 

 Quite a bit of the interior is similar to what existed with Tammy's. You enter and the front-area dining room is fairly narrow with room for a handful of tables. The interior decor is fairly basic, though they've added multiple wide-screen monitors on the wall to broadcast their menu. The menu consists primarily of a wide variety of pizza, both by the slice and pies, along with calzones, subs, pastas, salads, breadsticks, and a couple desserts. They offer slice combo options on pretty much all their slices with combos including a large slice, a couple plain breadsticks (with cheese or marinara sauce), and a drink. The drinks are all cans/bottles. The combos start at around $8.25 and go up. 
 

 I ordered a sausage slice, two breadsticks, and grabbed my bottle of unsweetened iced tea. The woman working the counter was super friendly and helpful. The pizza slice was extremely good - both breadsticks and pizza were nice and hot upon arrival. The breadsticks were also quite good. I'm not sure I'd say either item was the best I'd had, however, this was definitely upper tier for ""by the slice"" joints. I'd easily order both items again and easily return again. 
 

 This is primarily a neighborhood/downtown pizza joint. There are meters along the government center. There are also parking garages around. The sidewalk is a little beat up, but there are appropriate curb cuts. 
 

 The counter is rather tall, but the woman working the counter went around it to be sure to establish eye contact with me. That was appreciated. 
 

 Overall, Pronta is definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood. You can easily get a combo for under $10. While the interior is simple and a bit divey, it's clean and very comfortable. When it gets crowded, it can be a bit difficult in a wheelchair but it's workable and most of the state employees who dine here are used to dealing with accessibility and easily make it work. 
 

 I'm not quite ready to call Pronta a 5-star joint, but it's a solid 4-star joint and the kind of little indie pizza joint I love to give my business. The prices are fair, the food is great, and the employees are super friendly. I'll definitely be back.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your food options here are a burger or three different cuts of steak. I've tried the ribeye and oh my gosh it's so great. The steaks come with a salad, bread, and a side baked potato. The potato is phenomenal but they charge extra for cheese and sour cream. 
 

 This definitely won't be the best meal you've ever had but it'll be pretty damn good. The charm here though can't be beat. The bartenders are fantastic and the aesthetic is great.

When we got there it was not full by any means. The atmosphere is really open but not very welcoming. The concrete floor and high ceilings make it feel kind of like an airplane hangar according to my husband.

 So how about the food? It just wasn't there yet. The Gnudi app was good. My husband got the steak, which was good but the sides were kind of sad. My duck grilled cheese was almost good. There was too much cheese and bread and not enough of the tomato jam to balance it out. Again the side was sad. My husband liked the home made ice cream. I wanted to like my spice cake, but it was pretty dry.

 Only suggestion is when food is brought to you, they'd bring some silver wear or maybe if you order food, at the counter inform us to get utensils if we need them. A lot of people we're getting their food served and then had to go back up to get utensils. It was a small thing, but would've been nice.

 We were seated immediately and our drinks were at our table in no time. The black coffee is amazing! I am not surprised as it is roasted by Wood-Fire Coffee Roasters.

I'm no expert here so take that with a grain of salt.

I thought it was pretty good. We made it Super Bowl Sunday and it made three modest-sized sandwiches on hamburger buns. No problem with it - not the greatest meal ever but certainly tasty. Tonight I am having chicken marsala. The chicken is plentiful and tender, and the sauce decent, although my husband wasn't too excited with it. Neither of us liked the rice, which is boil-in-bag minute rice. It just tastes gritty and chewy - not a fan. At about $20 per 2-portion bag I feel it's not as good of a value I thought it would be. I completely understand the effort it takes to create these meals, as well as market them, keep the lights on, and so on. But since I have to also prepare and purchase my own side vegetables, and any required rolls, etc., I just don't think I will go back again for more. We currently utilize a boxed food subscription plan, and I find that to be good for us in terms of value, nutrition, and variety. I was hoping to add this to the mix for those days where we don't feel like cooking, but I think we'll stick with our boxes. Also, while the pork needs to cook for 8 hours, the chicken has to cook for 4-6, and we are not home for about 8 hours, so it would overcook. I had to cook this when I got home from work and refrigerate for the next day (today).

 The first time I went was for lunch. It was pouring down in the French Quarter, and my friend and I wanted to grab a bite, and get out of the rain. I ordered a Shrimp Po'Boy and asked the female cashier to make it spicy. She questioned me, assuming I did not enjoy spicy food, and I let her know I wanted it extremely spicy.
 

 The sandwich I was given had barely any heat. Very disappointing.
 

 My second visit was around 10 p.m. on a Friday evening, and my friend wanted a Po-Boy, so we came here simply because it's open late and in the Quarter. Although it was packed, there is plenty of room in the back, and the line moved quickly.
 

 Again, the po' boy was mediocre AF, and not spicy. This time we opted for the Crawfish & Shrimp Bisque (watery consistency), and I ordered the ""Who dat Po'Boy"" which is Fried Shrimp smothered in the Bisque.

I made a reservation, but when I arrived it was clear that wasn't necessary, as there were only 4 other occupied tables in the huge space on a Saturday night. After some confusion as to what party we were, we were seated on a side of the restaurant away from all of the other diners. We were in no-man's land, y'all.
 

 After looking over the menu, I decided to get the braised pork and smashed potatoes and David got the shrimp and grits. The pork was GREAT! It tasted like a home cooked meal and had a gravy sauce on top and the potatoes were fantastic. David liked his shrimp and grits, but be aware that the shrimp in the dish come with the tails on.
 

 I enjoyed the food, but I was expecting more from this spot. Our waitress seemed pre-occupied and there was little to no interaction with us. She stopped by once to take our order, once to drop off the food and once to refill my drink and ask how it all was. It almost felt as if we were being hustled through our dinner as quickly as possible. The place itself feels like a warehouse and the atmosphere isn't super welcoming. Also, being seated away from the main part of the restaurant made me feel like we were an afterthought the whole time we were there.
 

 If I go back, I'd probably just eat at the bar and have a few cocktails. I didn't drink, so maybe that was the problem- this place might be a lot more fun if you're drunk. I hear that they have a good happy hour, so if you're looking for that, this might be the spot for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Honestly, those were the first words out of my mouth immediately after biting into my burrito! OMG OMG OMG
 

 I had the preconceived notion that this would be no more than a 4 star experience because of the following: No ground beef is used in their entrees, the sour cream (if you want it) goes inside the burrito (which could lead to soggy leftovers), the food is from a food truck, & I am an otherwise loyal fan of TacoSon.
 

 Oh, how I was mistaken! I've never before bit into food & called out to the Almighty himself! Seriously, this was the BEST burrito I've ever tasted, & I normally detest steak in my burritos, tacos, etc. 
 

 The steak was tender & cut into very small pieces. The wrap itself far outshined any I've ever eaten; it had lots of flavor & it wasn't chewy. I can't explain it other than to say it was quite different & excellent. I didn't even add mild sauce (or any other sauce) because the burrito was perfect just the way it was served. (See pic.) 
 

 Is there a downside to Pinch A Taco? 
 

 It's not easy to get to in rush hour traffic on Nebraska Ave if you're coming from the opposite direction, I had to take back roads to successfully reach it-- where I encountered not one, but two ""working girls,"" & eating outside on a picnic table in the Chevron gas station's parking lot won't really impress a date. 
 

 But, if you love GREAT Mexican food, love supporting a local family owned business, & want a quick meal to go, this is where it's at! They accept cash & all major credit/debit cards.

 Only a small item is it does take a little bit of time for the food to come out. It prob. took about 15 minutes for two sandwiches to come out. This was not a big deal because we were not in a rush but I can see for some it being a bigger deal.  
 

 The sandwich had a ton of flavor. You could for sure taste the pork, pickles, ham, and Mayo. The break was super awesome and it was pressed to perfection. It was big as well. For $8 the sandwich is a great deal.

POT is entirely contingent on the location. I enjoyed it more this time around because of the sheer amount of viable seating space available here (last year it was shoved in the corner of Jefferson Square Park and felt limited on space - hopefully this year when they return to that location, it will expand a bit more).  
 

 Overall, it seems like this year had a much wider variety of both food and beverages. There was a decent selection of beer and ciders (all craft, of course, and a good mix of IPAs, lagers, wits, etc.), as well as some new additions of fun summer cocktails (adult slushies!). The adult slushies sounded too good to pass up, even at $10 a pop, so I got a vodka lemonade one and my BF opted for the tequila lemonade. The other option of watermelon sounded delicious, as well. They were absolutely delicious, refreshing and tart, although for $10 each for what's essentially an insane amount of sugar, I didn't wanna drink them all day so we switched to beer/cider. They were strong enough to provide a nice buzz, though.
 

 The seating extended an entire block from one end to the other, with the entrance in the center, the bar/kitchen/bathrooms at the north end, and seating throughout. There was a nice selection of hammocks, tailgating chairs, wooden benches, chairs, etc. I saw a few hoolah hoops scattered throughout, as well as some cornhole. Plenty of shading under the trees strung with lights, but also areas in the sun if you wanted to do that.
 

 Took off a star for the price of alcohol (it is a bit expensive), the single bathroom and the amount of children running around (it WAS Father's Day and it is nice they allow children in with their parents - and all were well-behaved - but every now and then it's nice to talk freely without worrying about who's listening).

She showed me around the cases in tthe front.  When I was assembling my cookie tray she gave me some samples to try which was very nice since she knew it was my first time there.  Thank you Annie for a great experience and nadines. 
 They also have cakes, breakfast items like apple straddles and cheese danish that looked absolutely delicious and fresh as well as pizza dough!

15609,A_03N4lqhxy-WElaBHsXdQ,"Last evening we visit Joe's on a whim for the first time in a year or more. Yeah the decor is shabby Sheik (I guess?) or is it just Shabby? 
 We both order the Queen Crab Legs Bucket. OK so crab leg amount is decent and unlike times in the past the legs actually have crab meat in them (this was the primary reason we haven't returned in over a year, I mean who buys crab legs for empty shells right?)  
 Corn on the cob was decent, and x2 tiny ""new potatoes"" are really an afterthought ie Not well done... No seasoning no butter nothing..... 
 

 Speaking of butter....you would've thought I had x3 heads when I (had to) asked for butter for the crab legs! Next up the crab extraction.... Only a plastic pointer type tool.... yes yes I'm very familiar with its ""function"" but the tools function of ""ripping a seam down the side of the crab leg has two down falls 1.) In theory that should open the crab leg=It doesn't as you must still attempt to open said seam and that can be painful to ones hands/fingers 2.) Without the availability of cracking ""pliers"" like other seafood restaurants, the plastic tool only pulverizes the crab meat, so what would otherwise be a long beautiful piece of crab meat is now stewed crab meat mush! 
 **Did I ask the waitress (who was largely MIA) for The Plier cracking tool... umm Yes! 
 I specifically said ""ya know some of these including the claw are very difficult to open and hurt your fingers/hands, do they have the plier type cracking tool?"" to which she responded ""Oh yeah we have those, we are supposed to offer those, I forgot""...... and that was it... never returned/retrieved said tools all the while we were both struggling to crack open crab legs/claw.
 

 Service: Or lack thereof: In hindsight I had noticed staff seemed to have a bit of an odd, disinterested attitude especially when compared to other restaurants .... 
 Upon receiving my bill, Yes I raised an eyebrow at the price for THIS level of restaurant... Upon return of my Card/the check for signing I took note, No place listed for a Tip write in... and a message about ""All inclusive Pricing"" and that the Tip was included in the bill. (Not sure how I felt about this after reading some restaurants were implementing this in the recent past, but know Joe's wasn't like this on our last visit.) 
 Just to be sure I wasn't confused, I asked our assigned waitress about the check statement re the tip was included... to which she responded ""Well the tip is not included"" To which I asked about the statement on the check that specifically stated ""All inclusive, your tip is included, and that I noted no place to write in a tip"" To which she then replied: ""Well we make more than regular servers here"" but I could tell she really would have liked to have gleaned my wallet for more.... 
 (here's tip (pun intended) Provide decent service and you would have still got one! To be clear For great service I tip far more than average! Up to 50% of the bill on occasion)  
 

 It then became abundantly evident as to why service at Joe's Crab Shack is sub par... Servers are paid more in lieu of Tips, but have no incentive to provide prompt service (TIPS: To Insure Prompt Service) 
 Thus our experience proves this model appears at least in this instance to Not work for servers!
 

 Service and overall attitude was definitely subpar.
 

 Price? To be clear, Joe's is NOT a fine dining establishment... what is reported to be 1 and 1/4 lb of crab legs (which actually equaled about x4 full bites of crab meat) (opps and butter because ya have to ask for that) x1 piece of corn on the cob, x2 Tiny Unseasoned Water logged red potatoes and a $1.69 piece of garlic bread, x2 Iced teas, no alcohol, no Salad,No Appetizers and No Deserts $89..... Tip included or not, Next time, we will spend our money at a real restaurant with far better food,far better decor and far better service!

Between running errands today ordered my sandwiches through the app. I use the app a lot. You can now tip on the app so that's a nice feature. 
 

 I ordered a turkey sandwich and a meatball sandwich. We arrived 20 minutes later only to find out they were out of meatballs and it would have been 30 minutes for more. We didn't have time to wait. I didn't lose my crap on them like I wanted to. I had it in my head that I was gonna grub on some deliciously warm meatballs. I was sad. They were very nice about their situation but I still left disappointed. They offered a replacement at no additional cost. I would have made my less than satisfied customer a larger size for free but I'm not the manager.
 

 The sandwiches were delicious as always. The bread is fresh, and the meat is tasty. The pastrami is always perfectly cut. The proportion of meat to bread is perfect. I only like coleslaw if its Capriottis'.

 We went last night for my aunts' birthday, about 14 of us including kids. Once we got seated the server introduced himself and asked if we wanted drinks, we said ""no, water is fine."" Then, he asked if we're ready for starters since we told him we're going to have family style but we're still waiting for more people. We said, not yet since not everyone is here yet. Couple minutes goes by, then he comes over again and asked if we're ready for starters.. keep in mind that our party is not all here yet and it's still the same 6 people sitting at the table. He process and asked if we know what we want to order, he mentioned that he can just put it in the system as ""hold"" then once everyone arrives he'll press the button. Once again we all said not yet since not everyone is here and we want to make sure that everyone agrees with the order before making a decision. 
 

 Once the whole party arrived and we were able to order our food. Indeed, we ordered family style since it's basically unlimited food! There were a few items on the menu that I wanted to clarify but the server looked annoyed when I asked him questions. I asked him about certain dishes and sauces since we wanted to make sure we were getting what we liked and not waste food.
 

 When our starters came out, we had to finish every single bite before being able to order more. The other two locations that I've been to, the servers ALWAYS always ask if we wanted more food when he/she sees that our dish is running low. However, this server did not ask us if we wanted more. We had to constantly ask for more and he kept saying we have to finish everything before he can put in more. So once everything was empty then he puts in more and guess what.. we ended up having to wait for another 15-20 minutes for our starters. Then next thing you know, our entrees comes out. BUT, he didn't even ask if we're ready for our entrees and then when we said we're still waiting for our starters and wanted more starters, he says it's too late once our entrees comes out we can't order starters. Like seriously? We didn't even get to enjoy our started or get refills then our entrees came. 
 

 So, same goes for our entrees. We were very hungry by this time from all this waiting and we asked for more pasta and meat since everyone was eating so fast. But, he wouldn't allow us to order more since we still had some food in the bowls/plates. My aunt wanted more shrimp scampi since there were no more besides the one that my uncle ate from the plate (literally ate from the big plate) and there was some pasta left from the other side of the table but no more shrimp. The server without asking or thinking, combines the two pasta together. He says to my aunt that there's more pasta once he combines them. My aunt said no she wants a new one then the server kept arguing with my aunt and uncle. Clearly, my aunt asked for a fresh pasta for a reason.. she didn't want to eat someones leftover. The server walked away with a dirty look.
 

 The girl server/helper was much friendlier and attentive then this guy server. I could write more but I think everyone gets my point.

Although our order took longer than at typical, more commercialzied quick service restaurants, it was well worth the extra 10 minutes or so. The buns were soft, fluffy, and not at all soggy. I found their guac perfectly tangy and complementary to the juicy, grilled burger. Surprisingly, I didn't feel at all heavy after eating this meal, and the others at my table felt the same. We even demolished an order of chili cheese fries between us. That side order was also delicious, and it tasted like they made their chili with plenty of seasoning (rather than just a standard meat sauce). 
 

 Since we were curious about the shakes, we ordered an Oreo and an Oreo Mudslide. The differences were subtle, but the mudslide tasted slighlty more chocolatey and malted. Both were delicious, but the straws they use are a bit too small for the thick shake. Otherwise, no complaints about the creamy desserts!

 I know renovations can be tough, but it does seem strange that there were no breakfast restaurants open on the entire property, and the little market they have was closed for another week for training purposes. You couldn't even buy a water anywhere if Starbucks was closed. 
 

 So why am I giving it four stars? The staff was very gracious and helpful during this period of construction. They placed staff out in the lobby to help people with questions. When I asked where I could get some water, they went and got me some out of the stockroom at no charge. I am looking forward to seeing the renovations completed. 
 

 The odd thing is that usually breakfast in the concierge lounge (or M Club) is free for Platinum members. But for some reason, that was not the case with their makeshift concierge lounge.

 I like craft cocktails in a comfortable outdoor area and so I love to relax in at the outdoor tables. That being said it's been hell getting a a waiter or waitress both times I've gone, throughout the evening. Bring a flare gun to flag one down. 
 

 That being said the doormen and bouncers were really nice and helpful. Stationed nearby they were willing to help flag a waitress, Sylvia. She was incredibly nice and took our orders but disappeared and we once again requested help from the bouncers and they somewhat happily obliged.  
 

 During our drinks which were very intriguing, a person trying to provoke a fight came and leaned on our table giving us a view of his back. When that didn't upset us he began quietly insulting us out of the corner of his mouth. I simply drew it to the attention of the bouncers and they happily obliged moving him on.
 

 So to the managers I'd say the bouncers saved your bacon and I gave one of them a 20. Sylvia was great but should be focusing on obviously high end quieter couples out to enjoy the evening outside. Market your outdoor tables as an alternative to the craziness inside, with dedicated service. Have your craft cocktails menu already set up on the table. The drink and presentation were truly delicious exotic craft cocktails and you are to be complimented for that.

The salad was with shrimp, scallops, crab, Chili lemon Louis dressing, avocado, hard cooked eggs, tomato wedges all served over a romaine base.

There was a short wait, but I was soon walked to my table and my evening of culinary delight began. 
 

 I ordered an Antipasto platter to share with my companion as an appetizer which comes with plenty of meat and cheese for two along with some olives and peppers. The cheese was amazing! We also ordered a Gamberi Shrimp dish which was incredibly tasty and very warming with its spicy flavors on this chilly December evening. The Tutto Mare, which seems to be a favorite from other reviews, was my choice for the evening. I love seafood, and this dish does not disappoint. The portions are huge, and I had enough to bring home for leftovers. The other entree at the table was the Ravioli Formaggio which was also super tasty. My two regrets are that I did not have enough room for dessert and coffee, and that I did not have a glass of wine to complement my entree.

 We shared a Philly cheese steak and an order of fries, and let me tell you, paired with the margaritas, I was feeling pretty damn good.

There's seating for around30 people in the downstairs dining area and an equally large dining room upstairs.
 

 The Decour definitely heightens the food experience here as well. Everything is served from what is effectively a family-style menu. The five courses included pita with roasted vegetables - the roasted eggplant is absolutely incredible, a delicious puff pastry dish, some spicy chicken which was not too spicy and was incredibly flavorful, lamb dish, a beef dish, fruit and some of the best baklava we've ever had!

 On our last day in NOLA, wanted to try a restaurant within walking distance from our hotel. Imagine our surprise and disappointment when we got there and they were unexpectedly closed for renovation! Doing a quick look on Google maps found Pêche just a short walk away.
 

 We got lucky and was seated at the bar right away with full menu. Amazing cocktails that were bright and refreshing. As we waited for our food, I noticed the awards on the wall. Two James Beard award hung on the wall. In 2014, Chef Ryan Prewitt was honored with a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: South. That same year Pêche won a James Beard award for Best New Restaurant in America. It's really no surprise that Pêche is annually named one of the Top 10 Best Restaurants in New Orleans.
 

 OYSTERS were fantastic but my favorite were the Isle Dauphine from Alabama - plump, sweet and moderately briny.
 FRIED OKRA was another standout. Reminiscent of Chinese fried fish but vegetarian, perfect batter. The sauce was a tart sweet accompaniment to the dish.
 GREEN SALAD with goat cheese, almonds, & dried figs was really good. The dried figs and goat cheese went so well with each other. Nice balance and not overdressed. That is one of my biggest food pet peeves - overdressed salads.
 CATFISH & PICKLED GREENS in a chili broth was another Asian inspired dish in my opinion. The broth was a nice spicy, sweet, tart complement to the lightly fried catfish. 
 SKIRT STEAK was perfectly cooked. Amazing char, tender and the salsa verde was a nice accompaniment. I only wish there was a bit more tartness and spice to the salsa verde or even a swap for chimichurri. But, honestly, the steak was probably one of the best I had during my trip, which is kinda sad since I went to a steakhouse that was supposedly iconic and ""the standard"" in Houston. 
 TUNA WITH PICKLED CORN, RADISH and SMOKED JALAPEÑOS. Is it weird that in lieu of the usual sweet dessert, I picked this? The tuna was bluefin. It was fatty, sweet and briny in the best ways. Honestly, it was the best way to end this meal and this trip.

15819,EZlMiY-b7cMnc7J2cwIqbw,"Came on a Sunday for brunch. First impression was confusion with two entrances and people did not know where the line formed. If you want to order breakfast, coffee, wine, you stand in the front line. If you want to order a salad, walk to the back of the restaurant. If you want to order prepared foods for later, walk to the back of the restaurant. No signage or direction was really given.
 

 Ordered the fried prosciutto sandwich with spinach and poached egg with a side of parmesan potatoes. The hizzy (husband) got the brunch burrito and jalapeno grits. I asked for hot sauce and was told to go to the front to get it. Very inconvenient. They only have ONE bottle of hot sauce for the whole restaurant by the entrance. Not even by the eating area. And it was empty. While my fresh food sat at the table 75 feet away, I had to wait for someone to refill that bottle. Like had to go to the back and refill. No extra bottles anywhere. The sides were both delicious! Although, jalapeno grits need some spice. I tasted no jalapeno. False advertisement. The potatoes were yum. My sandwich was less than desirable. Not very flavorful. The burrito was very good! Meat filled and a good blend of flavors. Prices were affordable. The huz thought they could have charged more for the burrito, but was happy they did not.
 

 The chairs and tables are so pretty, but the chairs are too short for the tables. Now, I am short so this is exaggerated for someone like me. My husband who is almost 6' tall felt the same way. He actually mentioned it first. It is nice to have pretty decor, but utility should be first for a restaurant. We did not like the flow of the space. That line is really blocking the rest of the restaurant off. It was just awkward. 
 

 Parking is definitely an issue, but if I lived close by, I would totally walk in for a salad or prepared meal. Just be prepared to drop some cash. $13/pound under 3 lbs of purchase for the prepared foods. $11/lb if over 3 lbs. Whole foods and Turnip Truck is almost half this price for the prepared foods.

I'm sure I'm not alone in not noticing it. Our server said nothing and when we got the check I almost added the 20% amount conveniently displayed at the bottom of the check but thought I should check over the itemized check where, cleverly hidden at the end of the food charges, a ""service fee"" (18%). So if you are not paying attention you will pay 20% on an amount already including the 18%. If, as the manager says, the 18% is in lieu of a gratuity, why on earth would the suggested 15, 18, 20 % options appear on the bottom of your check.? We are generous tippers and would never deny servers a fair shake. This whole business is shady and dishonest. Anyway, the food. My wife loved the lobster scallop risotto. I had two apps, cauliflower and ""crispy pig parts"" (at least credit Chris Cosentino with the phrase). There was only one pig part, pork belly with the fat barely rendered on a bed of too finely cut goopy cole slaw. Cauliflower? Barely warm, no char, floating in a pool of what can only be described as buffalo wing sauce. The Riverwalk cocktail is spot on, delicious.

 I really, really wanted to go to either Felix's or Acme for some grilled oysters but my friend isn't a fan of oysters and hence, he wasn't willing to wait in line for them.

 Soon after we stepped in, we were escorted to the dining room upstairs and seated right in front of the big screen TV they have hanging on the wall. ""I know y'all want to watch the game"" he said. And he was right. It was a Saturday and that means CFB!! Penn State was playing Ohio State University and what a great game it was.
 

 Anyway, back to food. Our waitress was the sweetest waitress ever! I feel kind of bad for not remembering her name, but she was super attentive, chatty, and friendly. She was also very patient in explaining the menu and off-menu items as well.
 

 I decided to order the fried shrimp po boy with a side of fried crawfish tails; and my friend ordered the Ultimate Seafood Platter (off-menu). The ultimate seafood platter is pretty much the seafood platter but you add a fried crab cake and some fried crawfish tails. Let me warn you though, the portions that they serve here are HYYYUUUUUUGGGGGEEEEE. If you're ordering the Ultimate or even just the regular Seafood Platter, it'll be enough to feed two or maybe even three people.
 

 If you're drinking hurricane, order a double. Once you finish that first double serving, your subsequent order in the cup will be charged as a single. Pretty awesome deal if you're looking to be drinking some hurricane all day long.
 

 Surprisingly, even after all the meals, we still had a little room in our stomachs for some dessert. So we decided to share a slice of Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake and boy, this was delicious. We pretty much left this establishment feeling full, buzzed, and a little gross of ourselves.

 I went to Eleven Eleven for lunch and ordered the 6oz. Char Crust Dry Rubbed Flat Iron which came with cheesy mashed potatoes. I was very pleased with the steak, it was juicy and cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes also hit the spot. (The prices were pretty reasonable -- I only paid $19-20 including tip for my meal.)

406194,puVNKTP-uXwxGGG1qQKptw,"I haven't ate here in 6 or 7 years and I was still craving spicy food, so I decided to GrubHub them. I ordered the samosas with meat and the garlic naan and the chicken tiki masala. I know, I know, no creativity in the ordering, but these are my favorites. 
 In my last 2 reviews I complained about the spice level of the dishes I ordered. Well I ain't complaining no more! If you're like me, you love spicy food and New Delhi got something for you. They straightened me out quick fast and in a hurry. 
 My delivery was prompt and still hot and all the necessary utensils, and sauces and even included a plate. 
 The samosas were delicious, large and stuffed full of meat, the pastry wrap was crisp and tasty. I really liked the fresh spicy salsa on the side. The garlic naan was toasted just right and after I slathered it with melted butter it was irresistible.
 Now, back to the spice level, when I ordered the chicken tiki masala they offered many spice levels, mild, slightly spicy, moderate spicy, extra spicy to name a few. I chose spicy, which was just below extra spicy. The dish was good, creamy and hearty chunks of white meat chicken and fresh veggies, the sauce was hot..... hotter than July as Stevie sang. I no longer crave spicy food, they put out my fire with a nuclear spice bomb!
  It left me wondering what extra spicy was like.......
 It was so spicy, I was comatose for a couple of minutes, when my head cleared I began to feel the burn and the benefits of the spice. My nose, throat and sinus were cleared, my vision was a little sharper, I had to turn down the TV because it sounded too loud and the more I ate, the more heightened the experience got. 
 I'm not saying this will happen to you, but I have always been a fan of spicy foods and the reactions I received. Whenever I need a fix, I know where to cop.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The setting is gorgeous, airy and light. Service was amazing, fast and courteous.
 But obviously the highlight is the food. It leans Mediterranean but there are some more global dishes (such as the pork ramen). We had the zucchini hummus, tomato soup with grilled cheese, the above ramen, pork belly, and coconut pudding for dessert. Every bite was flavorful and complex. 
 The hummus was fresh and light; the pita was perfectly grilled. The tomato soup was so rich and flavorful and the crustless grilled cheese was perfectly cooked. I just wanted more. 
 The pork belly was everything that it would be, rich and not chewy. The fattiness was perfectly cut by the grilled peaches.

 None of what I had stood out. It was ok, but not what I expected given the hype that surrounds Tucanos. Listening to other people rave about the place, I thought I'd be eating the best meat outside of a steak house offering aged beef. That wasn't the case.
 

 I guess the show in watching the workers carve the meat in front of you is part of the attraction. There were times, though, where I missed a serving because I guess I didn't get the carver's attention and he was off to another table.

 The Dan Dan noodles were really good, the mixture of mushrooms and the creamy tahini sauce on the noodles meshed really well together. The Korean seitan tacos left a little to be desired, perhaps they may have been better with a little more sauce.

Not only was it awesome to have something to actually eat, the cauliflower steak was delicious, ever so slightly blackened and flavorful. The price was steep at $15, but to be a vegan and actually have some real food was a treat.

Had a business dinner this week and the summer weather broke and we had a beautiful evening. Our hostess happily seated us on the large outside patio - a contemporary mix of concrete, color and art that fits perfectly and feels secluded (why a centaur?). Not that the interior is not equally spectacular - we had a drink inside the former warehouse that manages to take a large room and make it feel intimate. Bartenders were as friendly as they were proficient - recommend the Ryes n' Shine and the Black Manhattan - maybe one of each - or two of each - your call.  Dinner started a bit late and the hangry crew ordered three appetizers - I can make a case for any of them - will start with the duck wing because we crushed them and immediately ask for another order - lightly breaded and super crispy they are like chicken wings sophisticated cousin - the honey thyme glaze was good but the wings stood on their own. Next was the Tomato Pie and this time of year is right for tomatoes - the little tart was like a tiny pan pizza except the crust was layers of light pastry covered with cheese and tomato - a salad and the pie would make a nice dinner. Finally the Shishito Peppers & Cucumber with a creamy cheese (goat cheese?) that had us scooping up the bottom of the dish. A friend agreed to share the Carrot soup but rather than share the bowl - two separate bowls were brought out half full - very nice touch by our server. The soup was brilliant orange served warm (I was expecting cool) with a sight hint of mint - excellent. There was less sharing of the entrees - my roast Trout was served with pickled onions and a tomato compote (but not really a compote - sorry not sure the term) but mixed with the fish and the onions was just delicious. Managed one bite of the Fried Chicken and would be hard pressed not to order it on my next visit - the honey chili wasn't Nashville hot but managed to kick up the perfectly fried bird.

It is located in an old factory building which already makes it cool. Plus get this, there is FREE parking! The parking lot is behind the building and even though it gets busy, I have always been able to find a spot. The building itself is pretty big. When you walk in, there are two different sides to the place. If you go right, it's quieter and better for a family dinner or more relaxed vibe. This is also where the bathrooms are located. If you go left, that's where the party is (and the bar). The bar has a dive bar feel to it. They have an old sign with their name and also plenty of TVs with the latest sports game on. There are also ping pong tables against the wall. They have the tables surrounded by nets so you don't to worry about the balls flying everywhere. I think my favorite part about this place is the row of big leather couches they have. These fill up fast but if you come at a slower time, sit there. There are beautiful chandeliers above them so you feel pretty sophisticated. If you go to the back, they have a nice screened in patio. Make sure to take notice of the cool murals around the building and posters by the bathroom area. They have different games that you can play like shuffle board. Also, check out their menu. They smoke all of their own barbecue. If you just want a snack, the philly egg rolls are yummmmmy. I could eat about 20 of them. Drink prices are much better than downtown.

 Most single dining guests too often experience being sat next to the kitchen. I'm not sure why almost ALL restaurants do that. It's almost disrespectful to single diners. But, low and behold I again was sat right in front of the kitchen. Took about 3-5 minutes of me sitting down to be acknowledged. My server Savanna was nice and pleasant. I'm a pretty patient person, so I didn't make anything of the delay. 
 

 I ordered my food (the Grandma breakfast with added onions & tomatoes in my scrambled eggs, hashbrown casserole and added sourdough toast). She placed the order with the kitchen and brought me unsweet tea.  
 

 15-20 minutes go by, I noticed 2 guys that sat down after me were served their food. Again, didn't make anything of it. Figured they're busy. Another 10-15 minutes go by, I'm looking around for my server... 5-10 minutes go by, she finally comes back and says the kitchen is running behind. No, I'm pretty sure the kitchen or she forgot my order. 10-15 minutes later she brings out the wrong order. I explained what I ordered, and asked for it to-go at this point. She brings back a reassembled version of what I ordered, which was probably from what she originally brought out to me, and she also forgot my toast. 
 

 I'm out of time, I've waited almost an hour, I still haven't eaten anything and my food is now cold and still incorrect. Complete WAIST of my time and money!

124484,JF1NYA0tx1N7__wyNSZgyA,"Hogtown's name is a playful pun on the restaurant's location in St. Louis' Dogtown neighborhood south of the zoo. The playfulness extends to a menu with traditional and unique items for a BBQ joint.
 Hogtown has the traditional Midwestern BBQ menu--pulled pork, brisket, ribs and chicken plus turkey and sausage. Surprising BBQ item: corned beef.  
 There are a half dozen typical sides: slaw, beans, mac and cheese, for example. Apps include some nontraditional items--hummus, candied bacon, Frito Pie. A kids menu is also available.
 My pulled pork sandwich came on a hoagie roll that was terrific for lapping up samples of Hogtown's various sauces, which are served on the side. Pork was lightly smoked on site and included a balance of tasty inside and outside pieces. 
 I chose the recommended Pit Beans for the side. What a thrill! Combining two types of beans, meat scraps, and a slight pepper zing made a flavorful variation on traditional baked beans.
 For sauces Hogtown has its own original, a sweet, and a spicy version on all tables. However, Hog Juice (not on all tables) was the real standout. In a twist on vinegar BBQ sauces it lacked the pepper sauce and had a slightly sweet taste. Give it a try.
 My lunch came up super quick. Nice for busy folk. Service was terrific.

104583,yndMaVOsFxEnnxNaevlw5Q,"Though I think Yia definitely deserves higher stars, I thought Takemy W's review was thoughtful and sincere, and since a few people spoke on inconsistency, we waited until we'd had at least 5 or 6 meals with Yia before completing a review.
 

 First, I was SOOOO excited when a late-night walk along State Street ended up at this new place! I love Greek food and we stood there for several minutes memorizing their menu as it flashed over the TVs, still lit, inside.
 

 We went the next day and had delicious gyros, with amazing sauce, well-seasoned lamb/beef, and crispy high-quality fries. The moussaka was BEAUTIFUL, but very lacking in spices of any kind, which may have been a fluke? Or a version of moussaka Americans are not familiar with? Curious because the gyros were so well-seasoned. All in all, moussaka aside, it was 4.5 stars for us.
 

 Subsequent trips have provided consistent meals, except for two things. One is, the sauce is not always evenly spread throughout the pita, and several times has been clumped at the bottom, so we had to take it apart and re-build it to make the taste right. Second, the fries have been soggy repeatedly since the first time. I don't know why? They taste wonderful, but the soggy texture really puts a damper on them. I noticed the oil they use on them is really good quality, so maybe this affects how they are cooked or served? If this is the intended outcome, I wish they could explain that in the menu (which seems to go out of its way to educate people on Greek culture, cuisine, and language). I'm just not familiar with fries that are meant to be served soggy. 
 

 Frankly, I think the quality and taste of Yia's food is a 5, but somehow the construction of our meals, and the sogging of the fries, just takes that 5 and makes it a 3, which stinks because I wish these silly things could be eliminated for all involved.
 

 The staff has been friendly, the decor is attractive, festive, and super-patriotic, as we normally know Greek restaurants to be. The containers and bags are environmentally friendly, which probably adds cost to them, but which I really appreciate them doing, because that is super-kind to Mother Earth.

I got the pig kidney in chili oil and broiled fish in chili oil. My hubby for the double cooked pork and chicken in chili oil. The portions are decent size for the price. We enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. The pig kidney in chili oil was our favorite and the chicken in chili oil was our least favorite. 
 

 The reason why I gave this place a 3 star rather than 4 because it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out.

 After the food arrived the service definitely picked up a pace. We had intended to go Asian this evening, but our favorite Asian restaurant was booked out (we usually don't make reservations) as were several others in the Downtown.

It took 35 minutes from the time we sat down for our drinks to get to the table.We ordered a meat sampler plate that actually was given to us before our drinks got there. In addition we had no side plates or silverware.

Next we split the char siu rib (pork spare rib) banh mi - I think this ended up being my personal favorite of the three. What's not to love about sweet, succulent pork spare ribs? A classic done perfectly here. Ended with the meatball (Xiu Mai) banh mi - which honestly felt like an elevated subway meatball sub (this is a high complement, because I love subway) - it was certainly good, but not otherworldly as I've grown to be accustomed from these guys. All the banh mi were served on fresh and flaky Dong Phuong baguettes with plenty of cilantro, pickled carrots, daikon, jalapenos, and cucumber to round out the flavor and texture profile of these amazing sammiches. Oh and ""house spread"" on each of the buns too (honestly, please just spread it all over me). Supplemented our banh mi with oyster Rockefeller fries which were really unique: standard fries but the oysters on top were fried to perfection and the Rockefeller sauce was rich and creamy, I wanna dip everything in it - a fun spin on a NOLA classic.

 Suffice it to say... it was a long time coming.
 

 Overall, the food was amazing. We all four ordered something totally different from each other plus we ordered three appetizers. Because of that, I got a good idea of their variety and where they shine the most.
 

 Between the four of us, we all had favorites among the appetizers. My favorite was the Stromboli Bites. Anything with their Marinara would be really good IMO.
 

 My hubby and his sister loved the Garlic Hot Balls the most. My daughter loved them all, but thought that these Garlic Fries were the best she has had. In fact, she is planning to upgrade her regular fries that come with her burger to Garlic Fries next time. She usually tries to eat the fries with the least amount of garlic on them; not this time. She loves garlic, just not usually on fries; she is more of a purest when it comes to fries. ;)
 

 I ordered the Fish Tacos and an add-on of one Meatball, because I really wanted to try their Meatballs. I really enjoyed their Meatball and Marinara. I think it would be great in one of their dishes or on a pizza, but not quite worth $5. 
 

 As for the Fish Tacos, the flavors were really good, but there was WAY TOO much slaw on top of the tacos (look at my picture to see what I am talking about). I had to remove a lot of it just to be able to pick it up and eat the taco. On my second one, I just dug out the fish and took all of the rest of the slaw home. The flavor of the fish was great on its own and should not be covered to this extent. I personally will not be ordering this again, but I have so many other things I want to try, so this is not a deterrent to my returning. 
 

 My daughter loved her Bacon Cheeseburger and Roy Rogers. I enjoyed my Shirley Temple. We are suckers for those two drinks. Free refills, too.
 

 My hubby really liked his Club Med Pesto and side of slaw. I am not a huge fan of pesto, but this looked SO good (see my picture of the inside). The Club Med Pesto has grilled chicken breast, baby spinach, pepperoncinis, olives, provolone, pesto ranch, and toasted ciabatta. 
 

 My sis-in-love thoroughly enjoyed her Mediterranean Chicken Calzone which has chicken breast, artichoke hearts, black olives, and pepperoncinis. She got a medium and it was huge. She took most of it home.

 + Location: It's downtown right near the mall, so if you are visiting and staying in a near bye hotel, it is within walking distance and/or a cheap Lyft/Uber ride
 

 + Decor This place is much larger than it would appear. There are tons of tables, a mixture of high and low top tables. Plus a rather large bar towards the back. The design is modern with functional and comfortable. There are plenty of TVs lining the walls to watch a game while you dine.
 

 + Noise level- This place can get loud, especially due to its size and high ceilings.
 

 + Menu: They offer a gluten ""sensitive"" menu with a relatively large selection that specifically states how you should modify your selection to remove the gluten
 

 + Food- The quality for price is fare. Their version of deviled eggs is worth a visit. They truly are ""devilish"" with the spicy tomato sauce. It was sinus clearing. The candied bacon was was a nice touch. The Asada tacos were a bit messy to eat. While having two corn tortillas still easily fell apart.
 

 + Drinks - If beer is your thing, they have a lot of it, even two gluten free options. They also offer cider and a nice selection of mixed drinks
 

 +Service - Friendly and helpful

560049,SRBnqFfZpwPEPLJSUaInhA,"My friend and I were starving after getting pierced at Infinite Body Piercing (because apparently, piercings make you hungry) and rushed in here seeking sustenance. After being seated, I read the positive reviews on Yelp and found them reassuring we would be getting a good meal. Evidently, my rating and the rest of this review indicates otherwise.
 

 I ordered the B&B dinner which allows you to get a small bowl of pho and half banh mi. I ordered the lemongrass chicken banh mi and the saigon beef pho. I was surprised by the portion of the pho; it was bigger than I expected. That's about as positive as it gets with the food. I thought the pho tasted mediocre and inauthentic. I thought lower of the banh mi worse. It felt as though little effort was made putting together the banh mi. My chicken was room temperature and despite not having very much meat in the sandwich, everything still fell out of the sandwich as I was eating it. Not to mention, the bread was just blah. 
 

 My other main complaint, aside from the food, was the service. Our waitress seemed oddly friendly yet aloof at the same time. She did ask how our meal was and took our order with a smile, but she would simultaneously be having a conversation with one of her co-workers across the room or just not make eye contact in general. I'm not sure if I'm explaining this well, but I interpreted her behavior as disingenuous and as if she was just going through the motions. This probably wouldn't have bothered me as much as it did if I didn't already feel like the food was put together without care.
 

 The ambiance is a bit dark to eat, but I imagine this is the lighting that is better suited to intimate conversations and drinks. I didn't order any drinks off the menu, but some of them sounded appealing. I can see the potential for the ""Bottles"" aspect of the restaurant, but I would pass on the banh mi and the food as a whole.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
81982,sh4m_msrSzMiOMQGIKToJg,"I really wanted to love this place - I've been dying to make a visit ever since it opened - but unfortunately it was a miss for me. It's a great concept and I'm so happy it helps cats get adopted, but if you actually want cats to find their adopters, the cafe either needs to improve on some areas, or you just need to go to an animal shelter and bring that cup of coffee with you.
 

 We made a reservation (learned that the hard way) for a Sunday evening ($11 per person/hour, does not cover any food or drinks). All their available snacks are around $3.50-6 and their drinks are around $3.50-10, so fairly pricey for average coffee/cookies/etc (although instagrammable). 
 

 The place is very nice when you walk in and we were greeted respectfully. Staff kind of left us alone for the remainder of the hour, which was fine. There were 7 cats in the room, and 8 people; of course, cats being cats, maybe 5 of the 7 were snoozing. If you're going to advertise it as a cat cafe where you can play and interact with cats though, you better have at least a better cat to human ratio. Perhaps it was the time of day we went, but it seemed like not only were most of them snoozing, but they also didn't really seem to care for humans nor human attention. We ended up leaving early even though we paid for the hour. No adoption information was given to us at any point in the evening.
 

 Overall, the cost and level of cat interaction would deter me from coming back again. If you're looking for the basic cat cafe experience for your Instagram, this is the place for you - if you want a good quality cafe, playtime with cats, or to adopt a furry friend - go somewhere else.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I revisited recently for the first time in quite a while and appreciated their COVID setup (take-out safety procedures have become a new barometer for restaurant quality): order from a distance, large table separating staff from patrons, separate entrance and exit doors, all staff masked, hand sani readily available. 
 

 Food was good. My dad had requested specifically a shredded pork dish with bell peppers, and the hostess assured my what I ordered met those parameters (it did not, there were no peppers, but the pork was indeed shredded and tasted fine). Shrimp in two sauces (red and white) was enjoyable. Fried boneless chicken was reliable. The shrimp fried rice was stellar. I don't know if everything was vaguely under-seasoned, or if the seasoning was *subtle.* Regardless, we enjoyed our meal.

I had heard this place was similar so my hopes were high. My son and I visited after a quick trip to Petsmart. We walked in and there were 2 cashiers and some other employees (baggers?) standing around at the check-out lines. I saw NO customers. None in line. None in the store. Okay, I was there in a weekday, midday. Maybe it was a slow time? I spotted another employee and then a customer! I wandered over to the PRODUCE section. I was looking to purchase some pears. I couldn't find them initially among the stands of fruit and veggies. I got distracted by the fruit juice that was ""fresh squeezed"" and bottled in the ice bin. I then walked over to the cooler section in the produce area in search of pears. My son found them first. But not before I found ALL THE ROTTING PRODUCE. In hindsight I should have taken photos, but at the time I was shocked and not thinking. I legitimately was perplexed that they had shriveled up and rotten bags of jalapeños for sale. I glanced up one rack and saw the bell peppers were sealed in plastic and also shriveled and rotting. My eyes started darting and scanning all the produce.

I pointed each of these things out to my son, more astonished as I went on. I looked up and saw the store was still empty and I knew why now. I couldn't believe they were selling this food. Who would buy this? More importantly, why would they display rotting and disgusting food? I would rather see bare shelves than that! I told my son we would never buy anything from there and we would not be back. I never made it past the produce so I can't speak for the rest of the store. But I can say that I don't trust what they sell if that is what they consider acceptable for a grocery store/market. The employees were all still chatting and not busy when I left- hanging out at the cash register line.

 Cheesesteak dumplings were a simple appetizer with spicy dipping sauces. The sea bass special of the night and mustard glazed salmon were delicious.

 Price: The price point here is GREAT for the size of the portions. Three meals with alcohol was very reasonable for comparable restaurants in the Plainfield area. 
 

 Location: This venue has been many different things in the past and can be missed if you're not looking for it. Located just next to Quaker Blvd (off 70) it's a great place to stop for any occasion. 
 

 Venue: The inside of the venue has been renovated to meet the needs of a sit down Italian feel restaurant compared to the brewery that was here prior. The bathroom was clean and maintained very well, it specifically requests that the staff be notified 
 

 Food Quality: Fresh ingredients. The bread is made on site and I would highly recommend the breadstick starters. The pasta was well prepared and the calzone did not disappoint!

 The service here has always been good, and their beer selection is great. As far as the food, I don't know what all the fuss is about. Everything I've ever had here is bland, except for the garlic fries which are almost too much for me (and that's hard to do).

 We sampled a few things off the menu:
 Spicy King Crab - delish! I really liked the spicy sauce they served the crab in. Our only gripe was the way they served it -- it was very difficult to get the meat out without making a mess. They should use the shell as more of a dish, if at all, or just serve it without the shell.
 

 Duck Duck Duck - The meat was so tender we probably didn't even need a knife. Also the fried rice was delish. It was more of a sticky rice than fried rice. 
 

 Spicy Tuna Roll & Toro Roll - all in all they were yummy, nothing too noteworthy to write about. 
 

 For dessert we had the Matcha, Matcha, Matcha. Oh my goodness, probably one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had!

 Oku has a really beautiful patio with prime scenes of the beach and wharf - you'll catch a beautiful sunset for sure.

 Two bummers: 1) it is a prime location indeed, but with that comes the noise of the traffic and noisy breaks. It was a teensy bit difficult to hear each other. 2) Our drinks came a little later (after the food arrived) so there may have been a miscommunication with the bar.

A contemporary Thai restaurant with a mix of traditional and modern options. Prices are slightly on the pricier side, but the food is DELICIOUS. Great date spot. 
 

 Let me start by saying that I love pad Thai and have ordered this staple dish at many restaurants. However, the pad Thai here may have just become my new favorite. The difference? The noodles! I have no idea what kind they used but the texture and chewiness set it apart from any other place I've been to so far. The Thai rolls are a good alternative to the typical spring rolls, and the papaya salad was well seasoned and served in the very mortar (that I'm assuming) it was mixed in. A+ on presentation!

 1. The Brisket is good. I still like Dickey's better for chewiness and flavor, but the Salted Pig is doing well. They need to add more seasoning though. 
 

 2. The Pulled Pork is awesome. Don't change a thing. 
 

 3. The 1/2 chicken was flavorless and not smoky. I was told by an employee that they take 4 days to prepare the chicken. They cold smoke it, brine it, and smoke it. However, it was totally bland. I think they need to add more of a rub toward the end or baste along the way in the hot smoker. 
 

 4. The ribs were good but it seemed like there was a lot of skin on top and it was extremely tough to chew. Maybe we received a unique piece.
 

 5. The smoked mac and cheese was good but everyone in my family said they didn't taste any ""smoke."" Needs more of a smokey flavor. The potato salad was OK but seemed like the potatoes were a bit tough. Add some hard-boiled eggs and a bit more seasoning and I think it would be great (along with more time to cook the potatoes).

 7. They have some great sandwiches, drinks, and desserts that are worth trying.

My jalapeño margarita was well mixed with the right portion of boozy and spice served over ice. I drank two orders of these. My chorizo tacos came piping hot along with perfectly cooked and moist Mexican rice with a side of black beans. The chorizo had the perfect balance of smoky flavor and kick all wrapped in those moist yet firm hand made house tortilla. The flan as finisher was nice but this item is nothing to write home about - the standard flan taste. The quintessential chips and salsa starter had much room to improve. The salsa was pretty bland and watery, the chips seemed a tad too crisp / burnt.

 I will definitely come back to Hacienda Corralejo Mexican Kitchen, there are many other items I want to try, that other reviewers are raving about, ie Guacamole, Burrito, Enchiladas, etc.; all of this paired with great customer service, and great margarita to boot, this place is definitely a top winner in my books.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The location of this place and the scarce amount of bagel places in this area is one of the reasons for the heavy traffic i assume. I walked in and saw the assembly line of young woman working very hard which is why this place even gets 1 star. The cold case had a bunch of great cream cheese flavors. The bagel flavors were good and they had options even for 11 after the morning rush. I ordered 4 bagels, 3 with veggie cream cheese and one plain. When I got home and unwrapped this tiny little bagel it was a bad feeling, when I bit into the soft and spongy bagel it was a worse feeling, and when I looked at the amount of cream cheese they put in it I was just at a loss for words. I thought it was just a mistake in the one bagel so I opened the other two and they were the same. What an embarrassment. It looked like someone spread a tablespoon of cream cheese on all of them and even had the audacity to get the scarce amount on the top of my bagel . I understand this may be the only place to get a bagel but I would rather go to wawa and get a previously frozen sizzli bagel I'm not joking.

 We arrived before our order was ready because we were so close by.

Instead of explaining that one size will be enough for 2 people. We ended up getting almost 100 wings accidentally and youd think she'd have enough common sense to say that's a lot of wings for both of you why don't you do a smaller size. So natural when the bill came I was expecting to only see a charge for one order of wings but instead there was 2. I asked her why and she still didn't know how to explain it to me so she had the manager come over. He explained properly finally and I let him know that server had poor communication. His response was basically that were already receiving a good deal and like we were trying to scam them or something which wasn't the point at all.

 Last Friday night, September 29th, we went in at 8pm, always open to give a business a chance, when they have had good food! WHAT a mistake!
 

 So we tell the hostess, this young lady in her early to mid twenties that there is two of us and she tells us there is a tem minute wait. Ok, so we go and sit on the couches and watch a little TV and wait. She comes over to us 14 minutes later and tells us our table is ready, we follow her through the dinning room and there is 9 empty tables and she seats my wife and I at this little table up against the fare wall, it's the smallest table in the joint. Now, let me explain one thing I am 6'6"" 330 lbs, so this little table is not going to cut it, so I asked the hostess if we could sit in one of the five open booths and she said ""would you like to sit in the bar?""  I said what about one of those booths, she tells me again, how about the bar? We walked out and as we walked out I told her we would not be back!  
 

 This hostess was rude, and she cost the business $70-$80 check and now the business has lost a return costumer, at this point it is very clear to me that Skipolini's doesn't train their employees. That hostess, what does she care, it's not her business, she didn't lose a costumer, shame on the management for placing that type of responsibility on a millennial, who has no common sense on costumer service! Good Food only goes so far, continually poor costumer service is hard to fix and our last three visits have stunk! 
 

 I plan on making sure my 880 Yelp friends stay away for this poorly operated establishment.  
 

 There are so many good pizza place's in Reno, that the staff will treat you so much better then the ones at Skipolini's,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
519226,5Zjx1vhdZ5rVmVAlgI4DBw,"What an unexpected sanctuary in Tampa! Referred to locally as the Thai Temple, this charming compound next to the Palm River draws Thai and tourist alike on Sundays for a feast of homemade goods. 
 

 First things first, parking is available on site but fills up fast, as do the lines for the stalls, especially after 9A. Second, CASH ONLY. I'd bring at least $20 for food, drinks, and desserts. Lastly, it gets HOT (this is Florida after all), bring ice and a fan while you're waiting. I was excited to hear about the Sunday brunches because it brought back the nostalgia of the Wat Mongkolratanaram in Berkeley that I frequented during my college days. Everything is run by volunteers and the funds collected here go towards expansion of the temple grounds. 
 

 I arrived around 8:30A and it was fairly empty. I was able to float around the area for a bit and taking in the serene view next to the river. The picnic grounds are open to air with little tree cover, so it gets hot under the Florida sun quickly. Watch out for the hordes of ants on the tables as well! They're pretty harmless, but not something you probably want falling into your food. 
 

 The food stalls are on a covered wooden walkway surrounding a central building, but still open to air. Each food item has a separate station, with the noodle soup and curry/rice stations being the most popular. A small soup bowl was $6 (either pork balls or beef), and for $8 you'll get some more meat and noodles. It's quite a good bowl of soup and pretty filling, though I'm not a huge fan of the pork balls. I definitely recommend getting some iced coffee or Thai tea for $2, or bringing your own cold drink because that soup will make you SWEAT. 
 

 If you're in the mood for something less filling, try the fresh rolls, fried sweet potato and bananas, or salads, or take your pick from the seemingly endless array of desserts. I had no idea what most of the items were, but one of the volunteers working there was happy to give me suggestions! 
 

 When you're done dining, you'll bus your own tray by returning it to the walkway area next to the restroom entrance. The utensils are all disposable, making for a minimal dishwashing job.

 We tried what seemed like the gamut of the menu, and were not disappointed. Our orders included lo mein, a tofu dish, beef and broccoli, crab puffs, egg rolls, a spicy chicken meal, among others.  
 

 As a rule, whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant, we make sure to eat the meal family style, so that everything ordered is shared amongst the group. The general consensus among everyone was that while the food was tasty, many of the dishes needed more sauce, especially those that had a meat like chicken or beef in them. 
 

 It's very rare when I complain that a Chinese restaurant has too little sauce. Many places I go provide too much sauce, to the point where everything seems like it is drowning in it. However, this place was the opposite. The portions were very generous given what we paid for.

 I was seated right away at around 1:30 and I looked over the menu with anticipation. I love my pho, and I had heard raves about this place, so I knew that I was getting #44- Pho Tai. And, as long as I'm here, I might as well treat myself to some delicious egg rolls.
 

 The egg rolls came first and I was delighted that the four of them were a good size and so good! The crust was nice and flaky and the inside was delicious and I loved soaking up the sauce that it came with. Next came the pho and for $8.00 you get their ""one size"" bowl, which is really big and packed to the brim with deliciousness. The broth was perfect and the meat was plentiful. I can see why so many people rave about the food here- it some of the best pho that I've had in my few, but varied, adventures around town.
 

 Along with the fantastic food, the staff just couldn't be any nicer. My waitress was super sweet and asked if it was my first time and asked how I had heard about the place. I just think it was a nice touch for her to make small talk like that, considering how busy she was.

 Even worse was the service. Our server never came back after our food was delivered, and she didn't even deliver our food. I know it's a small place, and servers help each other out, but she wasn't busy. She stood at the table near us chatting and joking with her friends and looking at pics on their phones.

 I was here to try out the newest restaurant in the St. Pete area. This is one of the few restaurants has it own parking lot. It is free parking compare to many area here requiring parking fees. It is a plus. 
 

 I got the pork belly ramen to start. This ramen come with 3 good pieces of pork belly grilled to good perfection. I would add salt or sugar to the pork belly with better taste before grilled. The soup may want to add some black sesame oil to enhance the flavor. This ramen is good, however I think just need a slight improvement to make it great. 
 

 I got the chance to try their category five sushi roll. This is a spicy tuna top with avocado and Kabayaki sauce. In addition it top with imitation crab meat. It is a very good roll. Love the taste. The other roll is the their one of most order rolls- snow mountain rolls. This is a tempura shrimp inside and top with real snow crab meat. I think this is a must order item if you visit them. I would recommend this roll.

The place filled up pretty quickly come 11:30. We sat outside, next to a fairly busy street on the edge of the sidewalk next to cars flying by so maybe request a seat against the wall if possible. On to the food:
 

 Service was super quick and the food came out lightning fast. Our waiter was extremely pleasant and let us know about the rotating brunch specials and they all sounded delicious. We opted for the Omelette of the Day, French Toast Special (Blueberry Bread Pudding), and Chicken and Waffles with scrapple gravy.
 

 The omelette had roasted tomato, cheddar, and candy bacon and came with a side of smashed potatoes and salad. The omelette was pretty good, although the roasted tomatoes were whole cherry tomatoes and made cutting it a bit messy. The potatoes look super basic, but surprising had great seasoning, so don't judge a book by the cover. The salad was nice and refreshing. The French toast was delicious! It was fried blueberry bread pudding, so it was so moist and bursting with flavor. The chicken and waffles were also good. The brined chicken was tender although a fairly small portion and the waffle was just ok and pretty flat, but the added scrapple gravy was a nice twist on a classic dish.

104984,qxNO5AXLdyIXJvuxDwhmyg,"Another relatively new spot for BBQ in the St. Louis area that is doing a great job. I had pretty high expectations for Beast Craft, since it is on the local food critic's top 100 restaurants list. And fortunately for me, it delivered. I live in west St. Louis county, so it was unlikely that I would journey 50 minutes east just to eat. However, I had other reasons for being near Belleville, and didn't want to miss this opportunity. The outside is pretty spartan, as is the inside, but that's okay because most pure BBQ joints are the same - plus after eating I was sure all the effort went into the food.
 

 Service and staff were welcoming and helpful. There was a pretty good line all the way to the door, but it moved steadily to the ordering spot. Then you were directed to a table and the food came within just a few minutes. The manager (owner?) was great for telling us in line before we ordered what was good and why - especially detailing the pork steak (double thick, about 22-24 oz), and the burnt ends which were still available. These are the same items that the restaurant critic praised. He also gave me options of tables to sit at, and when finished he grabbed us a bag for leftovers and got sauce containers to go with them. The lady taking orders was friendly to all, suggesting and explaining the off-menu seared potato salad for a side. (It is seared on the griddle before serving.)
 

 Meats were top notch. The pork steak was indeed double thick. Yet it was not dry or tough. In fact, no knives were even available because you don't need any. All the meats are so tender you only need a fork, and that's just if you want to keep your fingers clean. Yet they aren't overcooked and falling apart. I say that, and then my next comment is about the burnt ends. The flavor was deeply satisfying, as good burnt ends are. However, they did tend to be a bit fall apart. But that was primarily because I had a portion with a large amount of fat that was basically rendered. Makes for a good flavor, if messy. The turkey breast was moist yet firm, with a nice rub on the outside that added flavor. Smokiness was only hinted at, and I like my turkey 'cue to be a bit smokier.
 

 Sides were an interesting mix. One we picked was the seared potato salad, vs. regular, that we were informed of. It was pretty tasty, with the searing making it reminiscent of fried potatoes, but with the extra potato salad creaminess. Brussels sprouts were mellow and smokey, with the pork belly pieces adding a nice contrast. I thought the slaw was bland. It used red cabbage with the vinegar base just not really having any tartness or much spice in it. The bacon mac was fairly decent, but tended toward the dry side - a little more cheesiness would have been beneficial.
 

 I wasn't sure whether to put the candied bacon with the meats or the sides. It's a side dish, but it's also a meat! So it gets its own paragraph. We had already decided on the sides we wanted, but I didn't want to pass this up. So I added a side of candied bacon to go, and let it taunt me all the way home. You get two full size, thick slices of bacon. Cooked up semi-crisp, and then candied with a barbecue glaze that makes it almost decadent. The salty, porky, cured, sweetness is a real treat.
 

 Instead of bread, you get two tortillas. They are just small pre-made flour ones, but I liked it as a change from the typical white bread or Texas toast. Not necessarily better or worse, just different - and nice to have that pull & chew instead of the mushy white bread.
 

 End results, a much satisfying meal. Definitely go there if in the area, and even worth a trip just to experience the pork steak, candied bacon, and other goodies. I think it's one of the top tier local joints. exceeded by only a couple others.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Finally. Our drinks come. We order a dozen chargrilled oysters..the alligator hash and a burger for the boy.

 Meanwhile.. my friends hash is good but her eggs are hard cooked. So they get sent back ..comes out with the eggs done correctly but the hash is cold. She gives up and eats it anyway because the eggs were warm.

My one complaint is the pricing of the build your own. They have MANY toppings, so 4 is sort of limited, and the proteins are around $2.99 each to add. So by the time I built my salad and added chicken and avocado, my total was $14. I opted for romaine, grilled chicken, avocado, fried onions, blackened onions, olive medley, feta and corn. 
 

 Once you order and pay, they move you to the chopping area, and that's when the fun begins! You get your choice of about 15 dressings. I'm a huge sauce and dressing junkie, so I was thrilled about this! I was having trouble deciding so one of the choppers let me sample a few, which was a nice touch! I ended up getting the hot honey vinaigrette (a slightly spicy, lemony vinaigrette) and the chipotle dressing. Both were amazing! They dump out your salad, chop everything up, and toss your salad in however much dressing you'd like. They even have bread slices if you want one. 
 

 The salad was AMAZING. Everything was incredibly fresh, bright and bursting with flavor. The restaurant itself is very clean and well designed. Each table had a little bouquet of flowers. The environment itself was incredibly calming! They clearly did an excellent job training everyone. I could not even tell they had only opened two days prior. They also have ""spa waters"" you can drink for free. When I went, the option was cucumber lemon. Their teas and lemonades looked delicious too. They DO have children's options too. I was so impressed with Chopt! I can't wait to go back and try more options. Check this place out for the freshest salads in town!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Although the menu seemed to have a solid variety, I have to question what they do well. It seemed like the Cheesecake Factory of Thai restaurants which makes it hard to find an item that is actually good in my opinion. You cannot do everything well. And for me, they did everything not well at all. And they did not even get my spice level right (making a bad meal even worse). 
 

 Based on the experience I have had trying to find a good Thai restaurant in Philly, I am getting more concerned. There were better options in smaller cities like Boston and Pittsburgh. Hoping that I just have not found the ""right"" Thai restaurant yet.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Our sever was a really funny guy and made jokes about us just poppin' in for dessert. I liked him. Everyone else who was there was going to town on their meals. We got a couple of drinks that were serviceable. Food looked pretty good. 
 

 The pie was really good! It has a much chunkier texture than what I am used to - I feel like most pecan pies blend up the nuts too much. I liked that there were more whole nuts in this pie. Perfect with a scoop of ice cream on top!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11984,B3Qu7fMrPQ5I533AQ4y_Yg,"Morimori is a sushi restaurant with some Korean options as well tucked in the same shopping center as Publix in Mt. Juliet. From the entrance, there are a few tables in their bar area and to the right is their main dining area with a sushi bar and several tables. Each table has a bench seating on each side which is kind of odd for a sushi place. I felt like I was seated really far away from my boyfriend because the tables are wide as well. However, the restaurant is clean and the ambiance is nice. 
 

 We ordered the following sushi rolls: 
 -Spicy Tuna roll ($5.95)-I didn't try this one but my boyfriend was disappointed by this one because he said that he thought this roll had been premade, stuck in a refrigerator then pulled out again. He didn't finish this one.  
 -Tiger Roll ($10.95)-My boyfriend ordered this one and said it kept falling apart on him making it difficult to eat. I tried a piece of this roll and it was okay but I agree that it did not stick together well.
 -Hot Night Roll ($11.95)-I ordered this roll which was definitely the best one. I was really happy with it and I loved the combination of the shrimp tempura, crabmeat and the spicy tuna on top. The sauce made it really good and it didn't need any soy sauce.
 

 Service was pretty spotty the whole night although the staff were nice when we asked for anything. We didn't have chopsticks or soy sauce bowls at our table and our server didn't seem to notice so my boyfriend ended up getting up to get the chopsticks so we could start eating when the food came. Towards the end of the evening (we were only there a little over an hour) our server disappeared completely and we never got an explanation that she was going on break or that someone else would be taking over our table. A different server cleared our plates and yet another server brought us our check. It felt disorderly and a bit confusing. 
 

 Overall, I wanted to like Morimori more than I actually did. The service was lacking a bit and my boyfriend wasn't all that happy with his food. I'm hoping since this is a newer restaurant they get these kinks resolved as I would like to see this restaurant make improvements.

Their little messages of ""prices subject to change"" is not a good enough excuse. With a side of the sauce, add 75 cents leaves me with a total at $9.

84557,-LrC9m_BXYf6owN9GJPUdg,"Restaurant week review:
 

 Who doesn't love CCD restaurant week? Multiple courses for only $35? Total steal. Anyways, I went with a decent sized group of friends to Estia for their restaurant week special. The deal was three courses - an appetizer, entree, and dessert from a prix fix menu. 
 

 Shrimp appetizer - I'm typically not a seafood person, but was really craving shrimp and this appetizer stuck out. The description was slightly misleading. I was expecting shrimp with a bunch of cherry tomatoes, but when the dish arrived, it was a few shrimp with a small salad and a tomato half. Despite all of this, the shrimp was delicious and worth it.
 

 Lamb entree - it's hard to go to a Greek restaurant and not get lamb. It's just so good. The lamb entree came with three chops, a size of potatoes, and tzaiki. The lamb was cooked medium, was soft, and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommend.
 

 Dessert - I went with baklava which is usually a good choice, but I was kind of disappointed. The pieces were incredibly hard and potentially overcooked. They were still edible but just not satisfying.
 

 All in all, the experience was okay but could've been better. I would give closer to 3.5 stars if I could, but the waitress was on point and it was restaurant week after all.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
